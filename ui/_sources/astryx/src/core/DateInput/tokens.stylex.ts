 * @file tokens.stylex.ts

 * @position Lab component tokens consumed by DateInput.tsx, MonthScroller.tsx, Wheel.tsx, MonthYearWheels.tsx
 *
 * The picker's whole geometry derives from two numbers, which is what makes
 * the fixed height and the scroll snapping exact:
 *
 *   pane height = weeks x day size            (one month, always 6 rows)
 *   body height = pane height                 (calendar body AND wheel body)
 *   wheel pad   = (body height - item) / 2    (so row 0 can rest centered)
 *
 * Every month pane is the same height as the scrollport, so `scroll-snap-align:
 * start` produces a paged scroller with no partial rest positions, and the
 * wheel overlay swaps in without the component changing size.
 *
 * The derived values are `defineConsts`, not plain exported strings: StyleX
 * inlines a constant at build time only through `defineVars`/`defineConsts`
 * from a `.stylex.ts` file. A plain `export const` fails the build with
 * "a style value can only contain an array, string or number".
 *

 *
 * `defineConsts`, not `defineVars`: these are inlined at build time and emit
 * no CSS custom property, so they are internal geometry rather than public
 * theming API. That is deliberate for both of them.
 *
 * The day size is an accessibility floor — 44px is the comfortable minimum
 * tap target on iOS and Android, and every other target in the sheet is held
 * to it. Exposing it as a variable would let a theme quietly lower the floor,
 * which is not a knob a design system should hand out.
 *
 * The wheel row height is only meaningful against the day size (see below),
 * so tuning one without the other produces a picker whose panes no longer
 * agree — a variable that is only safe to change in lockstep with another is
 * not really a variable.
 *
 * If a real need to theme either appears, promoting a const to a var is an
 * additive change; removing a var that consumers have started setting is not.

   * duty, and a mis-tap costs nothing, because the neighbouring rows are the
   * same control and the result is visible immediately.
   *
   * The row is deliberately close to the text it holds (17px), the way a

   * column of values, not as a stack of buttons with air between them. At
   * this height ~9 options are on screen.
