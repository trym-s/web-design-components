 * @file types.ts

 * @output The indicator contract: families, states, props, names, registry
 * @position Type foundation for stateful control visuals
 *
 * An **indicator** is a decorative visual that expresses a piece of component
 * state: the box a checkbox draws, the circle a radio draws, the mark on a
 * chosen list option. The owning component keeps the input, role, accessible
 * name, focus, and keyboard behavior; the indicator turns state into a picture.
 *
 * Componentizing them buys three things a theme could not otherwise have:
 *
 *   1. **Theme it** — an indicator renders stable `astryx-*` class targets, so
 *      `defineTheme({components})` restyles it like any other component, in one
 *      place rather than per host component.
 *   2. **Swizzle it** — `astryx swizzle <Name>` copies the source to own.
 *   3. **Replace it** — `defineTheme({indicators})` swaps in another component
 *      by name, and every component that renders that indicator follows. A
 *      product that wants radio visuals for single selection replaces `check`.
 *
 * Indicators come in **families**, and a family fixes the state space. That is
 * what lets one mechanism serve semantics as different as "is this option
 * chosen" and "are several of these chosen" without either pretending to be
 * the other, and without a shared enum that would typecheck `indeterminate` on
 * a radio.
 *
 * Each family's vocabulary is the one the accessibility layer already uses, so
 * a component passing state down says the same word its ARIA attribute says.
 * Sharing one enum across families was measured and rejected (#4831): it
 * produced call sites reading `aria-expanded={isOpen}` beside
 * `state={isOpen ? 'on' : 'off'}`.

/**
 * The indicator families, each mapped to the states it can express.
 *
 * Single and multi selection are separate families because their state spaces
 * genuinely differ: `aria-checked` is `true|false` for a radio and
 * `true|false|mixed` for a checkbox. Keeping them apart is what makes a
 * replacement type-checkable — a checkbox visual cannot stand in where only
 * two states are ever passed, and a radio cannot be asked to draw a partial
 * state it has no picture for.
 *
 * Adding a family is additive: declare it here, then declare indicators of
 * that family in {@link IndicatorMap}. Packages outside core can contribute
 * families through module augmentation.

 * on the components that lay out rows rather than part of
 * {@link IndicatorProps}.
 */
export type IndicatorPosition = 'start' | 'end';

/**
 * Props every indicator accepts.
 *
 * Indicators are **decorative**: they render `aria-hidden` visuals and own no
 * role, focus, keyboard handling, or state. The component that renders one
 * (CheckboxInput, RadioListItem, a listbox option) keeps all of that. An
 * indicator's only job is to turn `state` into a picture.
 *
 * The a11y props are omitted from this interface rather than left to
 * convention: un-hiding an indicator has it announced next to the control that
 * owns the accessible name — the same thing said twice (#4918). A replacement
 * that genuinely needs announcing is not an indicator; name the owning control.
 *
 * `tabIndex` is omitted for the same reason, one step on: the element is
 * unconditionally `aria-hidden`, so a tab stop on it is a focusable node inside
 * a hidden subtree. Measured with axe in real Chromium: 0 `aria-hidden-focus`
 * violations becomes 1 the moment it is forwarded.
 *
 * The omission is only half enforceable, and it is worth knowing which half.
 * TypeScript exempts JSX attribute names that are not valid JS identifiers from
 * excess-property checking, so a LITERAL `role=` is a compile error while
 * `aria-hidden` and `aria-label` are not — and a spread (`{...props}`, the
 * ordinary host idiom) bypasses the check for every member, `role` included.
 * Measured, not assumed. So the components also emit their own `aria-hidden`
 * AFTER `{...rest}` and drop a forwarded `tabIndex`: that ordering, not the
 * type, is what enforces the contract. Nothing else is stripped — a forwarded
 * `aria-label` still reaches the DOM, inert inside an `aria-hidden` subtree.
 *
 * Interaction state is deliberately *not* a prop. Hover and focus reach an
 * indicator through the CSS ancestor marker ({@link indicatorScope}) applied
 * by its owner, so a row hover tints the control without anyone threading a
 * boolean through React — and an owner that should not tint its indicator
 * simply does not apply the marker.
