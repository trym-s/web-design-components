# liquid-gooey

Liquid effects for React UI. Two effects and one modifier cover the whole family:

- **Morph** — touching pieces merge gooily and change shape like jelly. Menus, avatar groups, morphing panels.
- **Move** — the surface trails a moving element as liquid rubber with a droplet tail. Sliders, tab indicators, dragged things.

Plus **`dissolve`**, an orthogonal modifier: your imagery melts into whatever it touches. It isn't a third effect — the effects describe how the *surface moves*, dissolve describes what your *content* does where two surfaces meet.

Cross-browser (Safari included), crisp text/icons/images at all times, real shadows on the merged liquid, zero idle cost.

## Why

The usual gooey effect runs blur + alpha-contrast over your actual UI. That one decision costs you everything else: text goes soft, images smear, shadows become impossible (the contrast step eats them), and Safari renders it wrong. So the effect stays confined to decorative colored circles.

liquid-gooey splits it in two — a silhouette layer carries the goo and the shadow, your real DOM rides crisp on top. Same liquid, none of the tax.

- **Real shadows.** Parsed from `box-shadow` syntax and rebuilt on the *merged* silhouette, so one consistent shadow hugs the liquid through every merge, split and bridge — no handoff, nothing to flash.
- **Crisp everything.** Text, icons and photos stay pixel-sharp because they are never filtered.
- **Images that actually melt.** Opt-in dissolve warps imagery at the contact point with SVG displacement — two materials mixing, not a blur.
- **Safari included.** Filters run on SVG content, never CSS `url()` on HTML — that's the specific thing WebKit gets wrong.
- **It's real UI, not decoration.** The content layer is live DOM: focus rings, hit targets, ARIA and handlers all intact.
- **Zero idle cost.** Component-driven springs compile to GPU-composited CSS `linear()` easings; the measurement loop sleeps completely when nothing moves.
- **Two effects, not fifty knobs.** Morph and Move take 3–4 normalized knobs each, plus a `dissolve` modifier — with the full physics underneath when you want it.

```bash
npm install liquid-gooey
```

```tsx
import { Liquid } from 'liquid-gooey'

<Liquid blur={6} contrast={18} fill="#fff" shadow="0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08)">
  {/* MORPH (default): give items x/y and the library animates element and
      liquid in perfect sync — a plus-menu that splits like droplets */}
  <Liquid.Item x={open ? -54 : 0} y={open ? -34 : 0} transition="bouncy">
    <button className="round-btn">…</button>
  </Liquid.Item>
  <Liquid.Item x={0} y={open ? -64 : 0} transition="bouncy" delay={40}>
    <button className="round-btn">…</button>
  </Liquid.Item>
</Liquid>
```

Run the playground: `npm install && npm run dev` — add `?pro` to the URL for the full raw-physics control panels.

## The two effects

### Morph (default)

Merging is automatic: blobs share the group's goo filter, so touching pieces bridge and merge. One optional power:

```tsx
// Shape change: the liquid mass flows toward the new centre first, then size
// and corner radius adapt — content cross-blurs inside the moving liquid.
<Liquid.Item morph={{ shape: true }}>
  <div className={open ? 'panel-open' : 'panel-closed'}>…</div>
</Liquid.Item>
```

| Knob | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shape` | `false` | Liquid shape-change physics (springs + droplet travel + corner timeline). |
| `speed` | `1` | Tempo multiplier for the shape physics (2 = twice as fast, same character). |
| `bounce` | `0.5` | `0..1` — how much the physics overshoot and wobble. `0` = calm, critically damped. |
| `contentBlur` | `7` | Max px **your content** cross-blurs by while the liquid is in motion, sharpening as it settles. `0` disables. |

Morph acts on both halves of the effect: the *surface* (merge, springs, corner timeline) and your *content* (`contentBlur` while moving).

### Dissolve (a modifier, not an effect)

```tsx
<Liquid.Item dissolve />                      // the tuned look
<Liquid.Item dissolve={0.5} />                // scaled intensity
<Liquid.Item dissolve={{ mix: 0.7, active: dragging }} />   // full DissolveOptions
```

The item's imagery melts into a touching neighbour at the contact point — a liquid warp with two-liquid mixing, not a blur. Strength ramps with proximity, tracking where the goo bridge actually forms, so it needs no gating of its own; wire `active` to your drag state if you want it to clear on release. Text is never melted, only imagery.

Today it applies to morph items. Under `effect="move"` it is ignored with a dev warning: the melt is drawn from the element's measured rect while move's liquid deliberately lags on a spring, so the two would visibly disagree.

### Move

```tsx
<Liquid.Item effect="move" move={{ springiness: 0.5, trail: 0.575 }}>
  <div className="thumb" style={{ transform: `translateX(${x}px)` }} />
</Liquid.Item>
```

You move the element however you like (CSS, pointer events, Framer Motion) — the liquid trails it.

| Knob | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `springiness` | `0.5` | `0..1` — how tightly the liquid chases. 0 = heavy syrup, 1 = near-instant. |
| `wobble` | `0.5` | `0..1` — overshoot on arrival. |
| `stretch` | `0.36` | `0..1` — velocity stretch of the drop. |
| `trail` | `0.575` | `0..1` — trailing droplet size. 0 disables the tail. |

All defaults reproduce the library's tuned look exactly — knobs at rest change nothing.

## `<Liquid>` (the group)

Renders a `position: relative` div; the liquid silhouette svg sits behind all children.

| Prop | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blur` | `6` | Goo blur sigma (px). Larger = pieces bridge from farther away. **Bridging is a ratio of blur to gap** — roughly, neighbours merge once `blur` ≳ the gap between them. Items 8px apart barely bridge at `blur={5}` and merge cleanly at `blur={12}`. If pieces that should merge look separate, raise `blur` (or close the gap) before suspecting anything else. |
| `contrast` | `18` | Alpha-contrast slope. Larger = sharper liquid edge. |
| `fill` | `'#fff'` | Liquid surface color. Any CSS color; `var(--surface)` works (theming). |
| `shadow` | — | `box-shadow` syntax, multi-layer supported. Rendered on the **merged** silhouette, so one consistent shadow hugs the liquid through every merge and split. `inset` layers paint INSIDE the liquid edge — inner rings and top highlights follow the merged goo too. |
| `filterPadding` | `24` | Extra filter-region slack (px) if blobs travel outside the group's box. |

Plus all standard `div` props. **Size the group to contain the full travel of its items** (like a menu reserving its open footprint).

## `<Liquid.Item>`

| Prop | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `effect` | `'morph'` (default) or `'move'`. |
| `morph` / `move` | The knobs above, plus `advanced` (below). |
| `dissolve` | `true`, `0..1`, or raw `DissolveOptions` — melts imagery where surfaces meet. Orthogonal to `effect`. |
| `x` `y` `scale` `transition` `delay` | Component-driven position: the library animates element + liquid in one commit — pixel-perfect sync. `transition` is `'snappy' \| 'smooth' \| 'bouncy'`, `{ stiffness, damping, mass }` or `{ duration, ease }`. |
| `observe` | Plain-merge items animated by *your* code: the liquid follows the child's rendered rect. Implied by `morph.shape`, `dissolve` and `effect="move"`. |
| `radius` | Override the measured border-radius (`number` or `[tl, tr, br, bl]`). |

Border-radius is measured from computed style; percentage radii, circles and pills just work.

## Advanced (the pro escape hatch)

Every raw engine value stays reachable — the slim knobs map onto them, and `advanced` merges over the mapping:

```tsx
<Liquid.Item
  morph={{
    shape: true,
    advanced: {
      evolve: { massStiffness: 320, cornerDuration: 820, roundness: 1 /* EvolveOptions */ },
      blobInset: 2,   // shrink the blob so an opaque photo covers its own liquid
      bridgeGrow: 8,  // liquid coat that swells out and necks into a neighbour
    },
  }}
  // dissolve takes its raw options directly — no `advanced` detour
  dissolve={{ warp: 26, mix: 0.7, gravity: 60, active: dragging /* DissolveOptions */ }}
/>

<Liquid.Item effect="move" move={{ advanced: { stiffness: 380, damping: 18 /* MoveOptions */ } }} />
```

Exported for typing and defaults: `EvolveOptions` / `EVOLVE_DEFAULTS`, `MoveOptions` / `MOVE_DEFAULTS`, `DissolveOptions`, `Transition`, `presets`. Highlights:

- **EvolveOptions** — `massStiffness/Damping`, `sizeStiffness/Damping`, `radiusStiffness/Damping`, `contentBlur` (cross-blur px), `roundness` (0–1 droplet strength), `anticipation`/`travel` (ms the droplet lead ramps in / px it reaches), corner timeline `cornerDuration`/`cornerDelay`/`cornerEase`.
- **DissolveOptions** — `blur`, `warp`, `zone`, `range`, `mix` (two-liquid erosion), `gravity`/`taper` (pointy directional flow), `warpFreq`, `flowSpeed` (churn), `warpStyle`, `detail`, `active`/`releaseMs` (wire `active` to your drag; release completes in exactly `releaseMs`).
- **MoveOptions** — `stiffness`, `damping`, `stretch`, `tail`.

## How it works (and why it's fast)

You cannot run a goo filter over real UI pixels — it destroys text and images, and WebKit's CSS `url()` filters on HTML are broken anyway. So the library uses two layers with one source of truth:

- **Silhouette layer (below):** an SVG holding one plain blob per item, mirroring each item's geometry. The goo filter and the shadow chain run here. Filters on *SVG content* render identically in Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
- **Content layer (above):** your real, interactive, unfiltered elements — crisp at all times. Give them transparent backgrounds; the liquid below is their surface.

Performance:

- Component-driven motion compiles springs to CSS `linear()` easings (cached) — GPU-composited transitions, no per-frame JS.
- Observed items share one per-group rAF loop that **sleeps entirely** (zero idle cost) after ~0.5s of stillness and wakes instantly via MutationObserver / transition events / ResizeObserver / pointer events.
- The dissolve overlay renders only near contact and sleeps with the engine.

Caveats: the dissolve warps a snapshot of each image's `src` (rebuilt on resize), and writes `mask-image` onto `<img>` elements during contact — don't combine with your own masks there. `morph.shape` writes `filter: blur()` onto the element mid-morph — don't combine with your own `filter` there. Rotation isn't mirrored (v1).

## Notes

- **Accessibility**: the content layer is real DOM — focus rings, hit targets and ARIA are never filtered.
- **Reduced motion**: component-driven transitions collapse to instant snaps under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Theming**: pass `fill="var(--surface)"` and let CSS variables switch light/dark.
- **Item backgrounds** should be transparent — the blob is the surface. An opaque child (a full-bleed image in a circle) covers its own blob, which is exactly right for image chips.
