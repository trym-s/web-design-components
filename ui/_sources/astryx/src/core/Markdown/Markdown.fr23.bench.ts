 * @position Benchmark body for Markdown.fr23.perf.test.ts; not a test itself
 *
 * Run as its own process, one measurement at a time, by
 * `Markdown.fr23.perf.test.ts`. The fresh process isolates engine state left
 * behind by other plugin configurations. The harness must also run separately
 * from other tests: a child process still shares machine resources, and CPU
 * time does not remove cache or memory-bandwidth contention.
 *
 * The timed region is exactly the spec's protocol — ten untimed warmups,
 * then nine alternating paired rounds averaging 20 iterations a side,
 * reported as the median of the nine paired ratios — against the omitted
 * baseline, for a stable list and a recreated equivalent one. Each ratio
 * comes from one sample, never a selection by the fastest baseline.
 *
 * The harness retries a fresh process only when the A/A control is invalid.
 * A helper-overhead failure is never retried to obtain a passing sample.
