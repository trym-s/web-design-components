 * @file LayerDepthContext.tsx
 * @input React context
 * @output Exports LayerDepthContext, useLayerDepth, LayerDepthProvider
 * @position Layer system; how the dismissal stack learns which layer is nested

 *
 * SYNC: When modified, update:
 * - /packages/core/src/Layer/index.ts
 * - /packages/core/src/Layer/useLayerDismissal.ts
 *
 * Nesting is read from the React tree rather than the DOM. Two reasons:
 *
 * - **Portals.** A nested overlay routinely renders into `document.body` or the
 *   native top layer, so DOM containment reports it as a sibling of the layer
 *   it is logically inside. React context flows through `createPortal`, so the
 *   tree keeps the relationship the DOM loses.
 * - **Same-commit mounts.** Depth is fixed during render. Effect order is not
 *   available then and is misleading anyway: React runs child effects before
 *   parent effects, so an inner layer registers first and looks "older" than
 *   the outer layer that contains it.
 *
 * There is nothing to mount at the app root: the context defaults to 0, and
 * each layer provides depth for its OWN content, so nesting composes on its own.
