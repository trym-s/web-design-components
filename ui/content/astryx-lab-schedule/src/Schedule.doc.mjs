      'Schedule is a read-only calendar surface that renders events as a month grid, a day or week time grid, or a list grouped by day: the layout comes from a view object you pass in. It handles timezone-aware date math, paging between ranges, and async event loading, and exposes header slots that plugins fill with navigation controls. Use it to display an existing schedule; it has no event selection, creation, or editing affordances.',
