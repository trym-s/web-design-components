/**
 * @file CheckIndicator.tsx
 * @input Indicator state props
 * @output Exports CheckIndicator — the default single-selection mark
 * @position Decorative check visual used wherever "this one is chosen" is
 *           marked without a control: selector options, menu rows
 *
 * This is the indicator a product replaces to change what "chosen" looks like.
 * `defineTheme({indicators: {check: RadioIndicator}})` turns every
 * single-selection mark into a radio, in one line, without any component
 * knowing it happened.
 *
 * It draws NOTHING when unchecked, which is what makes it the default: a
 * listbox should not show an empty box beside every row. A replacement is free
 * to draw in both states — a radio does — and hosting components render the
 * indicator unconditionally so that works.
 *
 * Unlike the checkbox and radio indicators, this one renders no chrome of its
 * own: it IS the glyph. Two consequences, both deliberate:
 *
 *   - It renders `<Icon>` directly rather than wrapping one, so the class the
 *     host passes (`selector-check`, say) lands on the same element as
 *     `astryx-icon` — one element carrying the mark and its theme target, per
 *     the wrapper reduction in #4838/#4846.
 *   - It adds NO theme target of its own. `astryx-checkbox` and `astryx-radio`
 *     exist because those indicators draw chrome that needs styling; a check
 *     is an icon, and `astryx-icon` plus the host's target already reach it.

 * The default single-selection mark: a checkmark when chosen, nothing when not.

 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * <CheckIndicator state={isSelected ? 'checked' : 'unchecked'} size="sm" />
 * ```

 * Swap every single-selection mark for a radio:
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * import {RadioIndicator} from '@astryxdesign/core/Indicator';
 * defineTheme({name: 'brand', indicators: {check: RadioIndicator}});
