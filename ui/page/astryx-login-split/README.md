# Login Split

Credential form filling one half of a two-pane split, full-bleed media holding the other. Same fields as the card variant, but the layout carries brand imagery. Login, sign in, signin, authentication, credentials, or account access.

## How an agent uses this reference

- **React 19 target** — install `@astryxdesign/core` + a theme and copy the example from
  `src/examples/` as-is, or read `src/` to own the component (upstream calls this "swizzle").
- **Any other stack (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, Vue, Svelte…)** — open `static/<example>.html`: the
  rendered DOM of each example with every class resolved by the local stylesheets in
  `ui/_sources/astryx/` (`frame.css` pulls fonts, reset, component CSS and all seven themes).
  Keep the markup, the `data-astryx-theme` wrapper and the `--*` tokens; re-implement behavior
  from the Props / Accessibility sections below, never from the minified class names.
- Design rules shared by every component: `ui/_sources/astryx/docs/` (principles, tokens, color,
  spacing, typography, motion, layout).
