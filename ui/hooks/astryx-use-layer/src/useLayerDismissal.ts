 * dismisses exactly one of them. Dialog (and what is built on it), Popover and
 * the menus built on it, Tooltip, HoverCard, Lightbox, MobileNav and
 * BottomSheetSwitcher register today.
 *
 * `BottomSheet`, `CommandPalette`, `ContextMenu`, `DropdownMenuSubMenu`,
 * `PowerSearchEditPopover` and lab's `Drawer` still run their own Escape
 * listener. They stay safe next to the stack only because each claims the press
 * at element level, and the stack stands down on an already-`defaultPrevented`
 * press — but a registered layer opened INSIDE one of them does not get the
 * press: the host takes it and closes instead. Migrating them is the fix.
 *
 * Wrap the layer's own content in `LayerDepthProvider` so anything opened from
 * inside it registers as nested.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * useLayerDismissal({
 *   isActive: isOpen,
 *   onDismiss: () => onOpenChange(false),
