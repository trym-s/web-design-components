 * @file focusOutline.stylex.ts
 * @input Uses StyleX and theme color tokens
 * @output Exports shared focus-outline prop builders
 * @position Internal utility for consistent keyboard focus outlines across core components
 *
 * Centralizes the standard Astryx focus outline, shown only for keyboard focus.
 * Every focusable surface drew the same 2px accent ring already; writing it per
 * component meant dozens of identical definitions to keep in step, and they did
 * not stay in step — offsets drifted and one ring was a border-width thick.
 *
 * Every ring in core and lab is drawn from here, with one exception recorded in
 * Switch: its condition is a component-scoped ancestor marker, which cannot be
 * shared without leaking focus state between components. A component may still
 * override the OFFSET (a ring that must sit inset, or clear of a field border);
 * width, style and color are not restated anywhere.
 *
 * Every value comes from the `--focus-outline-*` tokens, which is how a theme
 * restyles the ring: one override reaches every component at once. The
 * `:focus-visible` condition is not themeable and stays here, so a theme can
 * change what the ring looks like but cannot show it to pointer users.

 * Longhands, not the `outline` shorthand, for the same reason the styles are:
