 * @file useEndLaneReserve.ts
 * @input Uses React and the shared ResizeObserver
 * @output Exports useEndLaneReserve, which keeps a field's input clear of the
 *   absolutely-positioned lane at its inline end
 * @position Tokenizer internal. Tokenizer parks its clear button, end content
 *   and busy indicator in one absolutely-positioned lane at the field's
 *   inline end, and this keeps the input's text and caret clear of it.
 *
 *   It lives here, beside its one caller, rather than in `Field/` with the
 *   shared field internals — deliberately. A measured reserve is Tokenizer's
 *   workaround for a constraint only Tokenizer has: its lane must stay pinned
 *   to the field's first row while tokens wrap below it, so it cannot be in
 *   flow, and an out-of-flow box reserves nothing. Every other field, this
 *   one's own Typeahead included, puts its end controls in flow as flex
 *   siblings the way TextInput does, which needs no measuring at all. Filed
 *   under `Field/` this read as shared infrastructure and invited the next
 *   field to reach for it; that is the wrong default.
 *
 * SYNC: When modified, update this header and the caller:
 * - /packages/core/src/Tokenizer/Tokenizer.tsx

// already has, plus a padding's worth of gap so the text does not touch the
// glyph. The two paddings cancel, which is why this reads as inset + width.
//
// The variable carries the WHOLE reserve, not just the width, so its absence
// means "no lane" rather than "a lane of zero width": with no lane up, the
// fallback resolves the padding to 0 and the input keeps its full content box.
// That is what lets the caller apply this style unconditionally, which in turn
// is what keeps the field from having to know whether a search is running.
// The rule stays static either way — one class, generated once, never
// regenerated as the lane changes.

/**
 * Keep a field's input clear of the lane at its inline end.
 *
 * The lane is absolutely positioned — it has to be, because these wrappers
 * wrap, and an in-flow sibling gets pushed onto a second row by a token — and
 * an out-of-flow box reserves no space by definition. There is no CSS that
 * makes one do so: the input cannot see a sibling's width. So the lane is
 * measured, and the input spends the measurement as padding.
 *
 * What the lane holds is not a fixed set: a clear button that comes and goes
 * with the value, a busy indicator that comes and goes with the search, and
 * arbitrary `endContent`. Measuring covers all of it, including the
 * combinations, and needs no constant kept in step with what renders.
 *
 * **The measurement never enters React state.** It is written to a custom
 * property on the field wrapper and inherited by the input. Held in state, it
 * cost the field a second commit every time the lane changed size — once when
 * the spinner arrived and again when it left — doubling the field's renders
 * across a search for a value no JavaScript ever reads. The observation is
 * shared as well: `observeResize` batches every field on the page into one
 * callback per frame instead of one observer each.
 *
 * Takes the lane's inset from the field's inline-end border, as the CSS
 * expression that positions it. Returns a ref callback for the lane, and the
 * style for the input — which the caller applies unconditionally: with no lane
 * mounted the variable is absent and the padding resolves to zero, so the
 * caller never has to know whether a search is running.
