# Attributions

Icons in this package are adapted from several upstream projects. Every
variant in `iconsMeta` carries a `source` tag so you can credit the right
project when surfacing icons in your own UI.

| `source` | Label in docs | Upstream |
|---|---|---|
| `animate-ui` | animate-ui | [github.com/imskyleen/animate-ui](https://github.com/imskyleen/animate-ui) |
| `lucide-animated` | lucide-animated | [lucide-animated.com](https://lucide-animated.com) — ported from [github.com/pqoqubbw/icons](https://github.com/pqoqubbw/icons) |
| `hand-written` | hand-written | Designed in-repo, Lucide geometry |

## animate-ui

Most icons originate here. Variants and SVG geometry are auto-ported by
`scripts/port-icons.mjs`.

- **License:** MIT + Commons Clause (see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE))
- **Copyright:** © 2025 Skyleen
- **Commons Clause note:** You can freely use, copy, modify, and redistribute
  these icons in your own applications. You may **not** sell a product whose
  value derives substantially from the icons themselves (e.g. reselling the
  collection). The Commons Clause applies to the animate-ui variants only,
  not the rest of the package.

## lucide-animated (pqoqubbw/icons)

Selected icons — currently `archive`, `bookmark`, `trending-up`, `wind`,
`zap` — are hand-ported from [pqoqubbw/icons](https://github.com/pqoqubbw/icons),
the animated Lucide collection showcased at [lucide-animated.com](https://lucide-animated.com).

- **License:** MIT
- **Copyright:** © 2024-2026 pqoqubbw
- **What we adapt:** Motion variants (`normal` → `initial`, `animate` unchanged)
  and SVG geometry. The React wrapper (`forwardRef` + `useAnimation` + mouse
  handlers) is replaced with our `AnimateIcon` context.

## hand-written

Icons designed in-repo — currently just `rocket` (variants `default` and
`launch`; the `lucide-animated` variant on the same icon is ported from
pqoqubbw/icons, not hand-written). SVG geometry is still from Lucide;
animation is original work.

- **License:** MIT for the animation code; ISC for the Lucide geometry.

Hand-written SFCs carry a `// Hand-written` (or `// Hand-ported`) header
comment. Both port scripts check for this sentinel and refuse to clobber
matching files, even when invoked with `--force` — a deliberate guard so the
codemods can be re-run without regressing manual work. An icon can carry a
mix of hand-written and upstream-ported variants in a single SFC; each
variant is tracked independently in `iconsMeta` via its `source` field.

## Lucide

All SVG paths — regardless of which animation project supplied the variants —
ultimately come from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev).
