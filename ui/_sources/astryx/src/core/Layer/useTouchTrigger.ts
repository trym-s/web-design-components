 *
 * Hover is the one trigger a touch screen cannot express. A tap synthesizes
 * `mouseenter`, so an untreated hover layer either opens on every tap and
 * lingers with nothing to close it, or swallows the tap the user aimed at the
 * control underneath.
 *
 * What the trigger DOES decides which of those the tap deserves. A trigger
 * that performs an action — a button, a link, a form control — keeps its tap:
 * the layer stays shut, because the tap already has somewhere to go and a hint
 * about a control the user just operated is noise. A trigger that performs no
 * action — an info icon, an abbreviation, a truncated label — has nothing to
 * lose, so the tap opens the layer and the next tap outside dismisses it. That
 * is `auto`; `tap` and `none` state the choice outright, which is what an
 * icon-button whose only job is to reveal the layer needs.
