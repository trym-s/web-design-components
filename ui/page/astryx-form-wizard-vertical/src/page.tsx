/**
 * A publishing flow with a vertical Stepper in a persistent side rail: five
 * steps, each named and explained, with the form for the current step filling
 * the content column beside it.
 *
 * The vertical orientation earns its keep when step labels are not
 * self-explanatory. "Payouts and agreements" needs a sentence to distinguish it
 * from "Distribution"; a horizontal stepper has no room for that sentence, so
 * it either truncates or drops it. Here the rail is the flow's table of
 * contents — visible the whole time, so someone five steps deep can still see
 * what is left without leaving the step they are on.
 *
 * The rail lives in the Layout's `start` slot, so it scrolls independently of
 * the form and stays put while a long step scrolls. Actions sit in the Layout
 * `footer`, which spans the full width beneath both columns: they are the
 * flow's controls rather than the form's, and pinning them means Continue is
 * reachable without scrolling to the bottom of a long step.
 *
 * ## Extending this template
 *
 * **The rail is a summary, not a menu.** Step descriptions say what the step is
 * for, in one sentence, in the user's terms. If a description needs two
 * sentences the step is doing two things. Resist adding per-step badges or
 * counts — the rail competes with the form for attention as it is.
 *
 * **Match the step count to the rail.** Five steps with descriptions is about
 * the ceiling for a rail that stays readable without scrolling on a laptop.
 * Past seven, the pattern to reach for is grouped sections with their own
 * sub-flow, not a longer rail.
 *
 * **The panels drop in order of what the form can least afford to lose.**
 * Guidance goes first — it is supplementary, and each tip restates a field's
 * own description. The rail goes second, and it is not dropped but rotated:
 * below its breakpoint the same steps render horizontally in the header, where
 * they stay put while the form scrolls. Do not shrink the rail in place
 * instead; a vertical stepper squeezed to 120px truncates exactly the
 * descriptions that justified choosing it.
 *
 * **Completed steps keep their status.** A step that was filled in and later
 * broken by an edit elsewhere shows `status="error"` while still reading as
 * completed, because progress and status are separate axes. That combination
 * is the point: it is how the rail reports a problem the user has scrolled past.
 *
 * **Uploads belong to a field, not a step.** The cover art sits in a FileInput
 * with its own constraints and status, inside a card that previews the current
 * value. Adding a second asset means a second field, not a second step.
