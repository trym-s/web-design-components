 *
 * Drag + snap machinery for the bottom sheet. Tracks a pointer drag down the
 * block axis, translates the sliding surface live, and on release either
 * settles to the nearest snap detent (a slow drag) or dismisses (a fast flick
 * down). A fast flick up expands to the tallest detent. This is the core
 * behavior split the sheet needs: DRAG places, SWIPE closes.
 *
 * A settled detent is split across two properties: `settledLayoutOffset` is
 * the part the scrolling area gives up as layout height, and the remainder is
 * a transform. Gestures and snaps only ever move the transform, so they stay
 * on the compositor; layout height changes at rest, in one transition-free
 * render whose visible geometry is identical. A peek detent — a stop that is
 * only a sliver of the sheet — keeps the full height and slides below the
 * viewport instead of reflowing to that sliver.
 *
 * Those are pixels, and the stops behind them are relative to the viewport, so
 * a sheet at rest re-resolves its detent on `resize` / `orientationchange`,
 * and whenever the host swaps the snap points, and re-anchors to the new
 * geometry without animating. The detent it returns to is tracked by index:
 * the pixels stop meaning the same thing when the viewport changes, the stop
 * the user chose does not.
 *
 * On touch, the scrolling body hands the gesture to the sheet at a scroll
 * edge. Two shapes, because the browser only offers one of them a choice: a
 * finger that lands on an edge and pulls away from it promotes by cancelling
 * the first, still-cancelable touchmove; a finger that scrolls INTO the end of
 * the content mid-gesture cannot, since the browser has committed the gesture
 * to scrolling and every remaining event is non-cancelable. The second shape
 * needs no cancelling — the scroller is clamped at its end, so there is
 * nothing left to scroll — and instead anchors at the point where the content
 * ran out and drives the sheet from the travel beyond it.
 *
 * Kept private to BottomSheet: a dismiss edge + detents on a bottom-anchored
 * surface are inherently sheet concepts. It is not a general primitive and is
 * intentionally not exported.
 *
 * SSR-safe: no window/document access at module scope; all measurement
 * happens inside handlers. Respects prefers-reduced-motion by skipping the
 * settle transition.
 *
 * SYNC: When modified, update these files to stay in sync:
 * - /packages/core/src/BottomSheet/useSheetGestures.test.ts
