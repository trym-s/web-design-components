# BaseTypeahead component contract

## Intent

BaseTypeahead is the exported combobox engine beneath Typeahead and Tokenizer. It
renders a bare input, search and bootstrap behavior, keyboard navigation, a
styled result listbox, loading feedback, and selection callbacks. A direct caller
supplies the visible input wrapper, accessible name, and selected-value
presentation.

This draft records verified shipped or audit-remediated behavior. It does not
approve a new prop, default, compatibility promise, visual treatment, or
ownership boundary.

## Compatibility and migration

- Released default preserved: `yes`
- Compatibility class: patch corrections preserve the existing public surface
- Controlled/uncontrolled behavior: controlled `value` remains unchanged
- Migration decision: none; unresolved public-surface cleanup requires a
  separate compatibility decision

Consumer migration instructions belong in consumer docs and release notes.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- Query text, search/bootstrap scheduling, stale-response rejection, result
  ordering, highlight, and selection callbacks.
- Combobox, listbox, option, busy, selected, and empty-result semantics.
- The anchored result popup and current dropdown/empty-state visual treatment.
- Direct-caller loading feedback when a composed wrapper does not take over the
  busy indicator lane.

**Does not own / non-goals**

- The visible input wrapper, label presentation, field border, or focus ring.
- Selected-value or token presentation in Typeahead and Tokenizer.
- Caller-rendered result content.
- Spinner presentation, owned by `component:Spinner`.
- Shared top-layer hosting, positioning, and dismissal behavior, owned by
  `architecture:layer-runtime` and `family:overlay-dismissal`.

## Behavioral and layout contract

Draft requirements identify their observational or current-authority basis.

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| FR1 | The input is controlled by internal query state while `value` is caller-controlled; selecting a result calls `onChange(item)`, clears query/results, closes the popup, and returns focus to the input.                                                        | Current source and tests                              | verified shipped behavior                      |
| FR2 | Search starts only at the grapheme-count threshold, uses the configured debounce, and never presents an empty result for a query that was not searched.                                                                                                       | Public API, current i18n character utility, tests     | verified audit remediation                     |
| FR3 | A newer query, selection, clear, source replacement, or unmount invalidates stale asynchronous work. Escape hides the current popup but does not invalidate pending work, so a late response currently reopens it (retained violation).                       | Current source, focused retained-red probe, and tests | verified shipped behavior                      |
| FR4 | The popup is a named listbox whose result rows are options. A completed empty search renders one disabled option so the listbox retains a valid owned child.                                                                                                  | APG combobox pattern, axe, tests                      | verified audit remediation                     |
| FR5 | Arrow keys wrap the highlight; Home/End move to the first/last option; Enter selects; Escape and Tab hide the current popup; IME-owned key events do not activate combobox commands. Escape dismissal is not durable while source work remains pending (FR3). | Current source and tests                              | verified shipped behavior; Escape gap retained |
| FR6 | Pending asynchronous source work sets `aria-busy` and renders one named Spinner unless the composed wrapper owns the busy indicator lane.                                                                                                                     | Current source, input-family FR7, tests               | verified shipped behavior                      |
| FR7 | Supported BaseProps DOM, ARIA, data, class, style, event, and `xstyle` inputs reach the combobox input while component-owned role, state, value, and behavior remain authoritative.                                                                           | `architecture:public-component-api/INV5–INV7`, tests  | verified audit remediation                     |
| FR8 | The popup remains within the inline viewport at 320 CSS px, including long default results and a requested width larger than the available viewport.                                                                                                          | WCAG 1.4.10, real Chromium                            | verified audit remediation                     |
| FR9 | Native disabled removes ordinary focus and activation. Focusable-disabled uses `aria-disabled` plus `readOnly` and blocks text/query mutation, but applying it after the popup opens does not currently block Enter selection (retained violation).           | Current source, tests, and focused retained-red probe | verified shipped behavior                      |

### Allowed variation

- Search and bootstrap may complete synchronously or asynchronously.
- Results may be grouped or ungrouped and may use default or caller-rendered
  content.
- A direct caller may anchor the popup to the input or to its own wrapper.
- Typeahead and Tokenizer may own the visible wrapper and busy-indicator lane.

### Representative states

| results           | one highlighted option and valid active descendant                                                                                    | grouped/default/custom content         |
| completed empty   | one disabled empty option; no active descendant                                                                                       | caller-supplied empty text             |
| selected result   | matching option exposes `aria-selected=true`                                                                                          | generic check presentation             |
| disabled          | native disabled blocks activation; focusable-disabled blocks query mutation but can still select an already-open highlight with Enter | native or focusable-disabled semantics |
| dismissed pending | Escape hides the popup; a late pending response currently reopens it                                                                  | source completion timing               |
| narrow viewport   | popup and result content remain inside two viewport gutters                                                                           | intrinsic or requested width           |

### Transformation and precedence order

- **ORD1 — Result content.** `item.element` → caller `renderItem` →
  TypeaheadItem.
- **ORD2 — Input props.** Consumer rest props → defined legacy aliases (`inputId`,
  `ariaDescribedBy`, `ariaLabelledBy`, `inputTabIndex`) → component-owned
  semantics and handlers → component styles → consumer class/style escape
  hatches. An omitted legacy alias preserves its equivalent native BaseProp.

### Performance and resources

- **PR1 — Search lifetime.** One generation counter rejects stale responses,
  including responses from a source that has since been replaced; debounce
  timers and optional source cancellation are cleared on replacement and
  unmount.

## Accessibility contract

- **AR1 — Combobox pattern.** DOM focus stays on the input while
  `aria-activedescendant` identifies the highlighted option in the named listbox.
- **AR2 — Accessible name.** A direct caller supplies `aria-label` or a valid
  `aria-labelledby` relationship; composed owners supply their visible label ID.
- **AR3 — State.** Expanded, busy, disabled, active-descendant, and selected
  states are exposed programmatically.
- **AR4 — Result feedback.** Active queries announce the localized result count
  or empty-result message through the shared announcer.
- **AR5 — Input method.** IME composition commands remain with the candidate
  window; ordinary keyboard and pointer selection remain equivalent.

## Family and system relationships

- `family:overlay-dismissal` owns Escape and platform-close ordering while the
  popup is present.
- `architecture:layer-runtime` owns top-layer hosting, anchoring, viewport
  positioning, and native light dismissal.
- `architecture:public-component-api` owns reachable exports and BaseProps
  passthrough semantics.
- `architecture:component-theming-surface` owns anatomy qualification and target
  disposition.

## Decision log

None. This draft records current or objectively remediated behavior and makes no
component-local API, design, compatibility, or ownership decision.

## Open questions

- **OQ1 — How should the released public props type remove package-internal
  composition knobs such as `__queryEntries`, `isFocusableDisabled`, and
  `inputTabIndex`?** (`human-api`)
- **OQ2 — Should `inputXStyle` be deprecated now that the inherited `xstyle`
  contract correctly reaches the same input?** (`human-api`)
- **OQ3 — Does bare BaseTypeahead own a default focus-visible ring, or must every
  direct caller provide the ring on its wrapper?** (`human-design`)

## Content boundary

This file does not duplicate the prop reference, examples, current audit score,
shared layer mechanics, or shared accessibility and theming rules.
