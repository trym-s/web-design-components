/**
 * @file useOwnScrollGesture.ts
 * @input A scroll container ref and which axis it owns
 * @output Stops touch gestures on that container from reaching an ancestor
 * @position Internal behavior hook; consumed by Wheel.tsx and MonthScroller.tsx
 *
 * Lets a nested scroller keep the finger that lands on it.
 *
 * ## The conflict
 *
 * `BottomSheet` implements swipe-to-dismiss by watching touches on its
 * scrolling body: at the body's scroll top, a downward pull stops being a
 * scroll and becomes a sheet drag. The test is `body.scrollTop`, and the body
 * of a sheet sized to hug its content never scrolls, so it reads as "at the
 * top" forever — every downward-ish drag anywhere inside promotes to a drag.
 *
 * `touch-action` does NOT protect against this. It governs what the BROWSER
 * will pan natively; the sheet's listener is JavaScript, and its
 * `preventDefault()` cancels the native scroll whatever `touch-action` says.
 * Measured: with `touch-action: pan-x` on the month scroller, a swipe just 9°
 * off horizontal (120px across, 20px down — an ordinary thumb arc) had every
 * `touchmove` cancelled by the sheet, so the calendar did not move at all and
 * the sheet sprang back. The month simply would not change.
 *
 * ## Two ways to own a gesture
 *
 * - `'all'` — the wheels. They scroll vertically, exactly the axis the sheet
 *   wants, so there is no way to share: the scroller takes every touch that
 *   lands on it and the sheet is dismissed from the handle, the header or the
 *   scrim instead.
 *
 * - `'inline'` — the month scroller. It pages sideways, so the two CAN share
 *   by direction: lock the axis on the first significant move, claim the
 *   gesture only when it is horizontal, and let vertical ones through so
 *   swipe-to-dismiss still works on the calendar.
 *
 * ## Where the line falls, and the gestures that fall past it
 *
 * A thumb swiping sideways travels in an arc, not a line — a "horizontal"
 * swipe routinely drifts 10-30° down, and sometimes further. So an `'inline'`
 * scroller claims generously: vertical has to beat horizontal by
 * {@link VERTICAL_DOMINANCE} before the sheet gets the gesture, which puts the
 * split near 63° rather than at the diagonal.
 *
 * That is wider than the browser will pan. `touch-action: pan-x` pans only
 * while `|dx| > |dy|` and refuses the moment a gesture tips past 45°, so the
 * band between the two lines used to be the worst outcome available: measured
 * on an iPhone 15 profile, a 200px swipe at 45-60° neither paged a month nor
 * dismissed the sheet, because we had told the sheet to keep off a gesture the
 * compositor then declined to pan. Nothing moved at all.
 *
 * {@link OwnScrollGestureOptions.onSwipe} closes that band, and it does not
 * need to know where the browser's line is: if the element's scroll offset
 * never changed across a claimed gesture, the browser declined it, and a
 * swipe that cleared {@link SWIPE_DISTANCE} is reported so the caller can page
 * itself. Native pans keep their momentum and snapping and report nothing.
 *
 * The remaining asymmetry is deliberate and in the direction the scroller
 * needs: it is generous about distance too, paging on a 30px flick where the
 * sheet asks for ~200px of pull before it dismisses.
 *
 * ## Why native listeners
 *
 * React delegates its events at the root container, which is an ANCESTOR of
 * the sheet body — so a React `onTouchStart` would run after the body's own
 * listener had already claimed the gesture. `stopPropagation` has to happen on
 * a listener attached to the element itself, during the real bubble phase,
 * before the event ever reaches the body.
 *
 * Nothing here calls `preventDefault`, so the listeners stay passive and the
 * scroller keeps native momentum, snapping and rubber-banding.
 *
 * SYNC: When modified, update DateInputTouch.test.tsx.
