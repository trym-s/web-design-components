# Banner component contract

## Intent

Banner presents a persistent status message at the top of a page or section.
This contract records the current painted surfaces and the Banner frame as a
separately targetable surface. The status and content targets remain unchanged.

## Compatibility and migration

- Released default preserved: `yes`
- Compatibility class: additive public theming target; no existing target,
  runtime default, DOM, prop, or behavior changes
- Controlled/uncontrolled behavior: unchanged
- Migration decision: none; new themes use `banner-frame` for frame-specific
  overrides

Consumer migration instructions belong in consumer docs and release notes.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- The current status surface as Banner's primary painted surface.
- The optional content surface below it.
- The Banner frame that groups both surfaces and carries the current whole-banner
  elevation and elevated-card silhouette.

**Does not own / non-goals**

- Painting for action and dismiss controls — delegated to `component:Button`.
- A new theme property, prop, variant, or DOM element.

## Public concepts

The Banner frame is a stable public theming concept. Its target is
`banner-frame`, and it reflects the existing `container` and `elevation` axes.
The existing `banner` target remains on the Status surface and continues to
reflect `container` and `status`.

Consumer props, defaults, and usage remain documented in `Banner.doc.mjs`. No
prop vocabulary or extensibility rule changes.

## Behavioral and layout contract

The requirements below describe the current implementation and its additive
frame target contract.

| ID  | Invariant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Basis                                          | Contract state           |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| FR1 | The current render places `banner` on the colored status surface, which is Banner's primary painted surface and reflects `container` and `status`.                                                                                                                   | Current source, public docs, and tests         | Current behavior         |
| FR2 | The Banner frame receives the public ref, role, supported DOM props, `xstyle`, `className`, and `style`; it also paints the selected `boxShadow`.                                                                                                                    | Current source and tests                       | Current behavior         |
| FR3 | An elevated `card` frame also paints the whole-banner radius. A `section` frame remains square. A non-elevated frame does not receive the frame-radius style.                                                                                                        | Current source and elevation tests             | Current behavior         |
| FR4 | Card shape is split across surface owners: the status surface owns all corners without visible content or the top corners with visible content; the content surface owns the bottom corners.                                                                         | Current source                                 | Current behavior         |
| FR5 | Theme-authored `borderRadius` on `banner` currently writes the private `--_banner-radius` variable on the Status surface only. CSS inheritance does not carry that value upward to the frame or sideways to the Content surface, so both keep their fallback radius. | Current compiler output and CSS inheritance    | Current reachability gap |
| FR6 | The Banner frame exposes `banner-frame` and reflects `container` and `elevation`. The existing `banner` target remains on the Status surface rather than moving to the outermost DOM element.                                                                        | Owner decision; current source and tests       | Current behavior         |
| FR7 | `banner-frame` is additive. The existing `banner`, `banner-icon`, `banner-description`, and `banner-content` targets and their current axes remain unchanged.                                                                                                        | Current target inventory; compatibility policy | Current behavior         |

### Allowed variation

- **AV1 — Content presence.** The content surface may be absent, collapsed,
  expanded, or always visible under the existing `collapsible` contract.
- **AV2 — Target scope.** Themes use `banner-frame` for the whole Banner
  silhouette and elevation, `banner` for the primary Status surface, and the
  existing child targets for their owned parts.

### Representative states

| State                          | Required current behavior                                                                                           | Allowed variation                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Flat card, no visible content  | Status surface is the full rounded painted surface; frame shadow is `none` and frame radius styling is absent.      | Status, text, controls, and theme paint |
| Elevated card, visible content | Frame paints the whole shadow and radius; status surface paints top corners; content surface paints bottom corners. | Elevation tier and content              |
| Elevated section               | Frame paints the whole shadow without card radius; status and content surfaces remain square.                       | Elevation tier and content              |
| Custom radius on `banner`      | Status surface receives the private radius value; frame and Content surface keep their fallback radius.             | Authored radius value                   |

### Transformation and precedence order

- **ORD1 — Surface resolution.** Resolve `container`, `elevation`, and visible
  content; apply whole-banner elevation and any elevated-card radius to the
  Banner frame; then render the targeted status and optional targeted content
  surfaces.
- **ORD2 — Current radius routing.** Theme compilation writes a
  `borderRadius` authored on `banner` to the private radius variable on the
  Status surface. That value does not inherit to the ancestor frame or sibling
  Content surface. Consumers do not author the private variable directly.

### Performance and resources

This contract introduces no new measurement, observer, listener, render pass, or
runtime work.

## Accessibility contract

This contract does not change Banner's current status roles, announcements,
focus handoff, disclosure controls, or accessible control names.

| Banner frame            | Groups the status and optional content surfaces and carries their shared silhouette and elevation. | Current source and public docs | Supporting     | FR2, FR3, FR4      |
| Status surface          | Acts as Banner's primary painted surface, carrying the status fill, message, and controls.         | Current source and public docs | Prominent      | FR1                |
| Content surface         | Carries optional supporting detail below the status surface.                                       | Current source and public docs | Supporting     | FR4, FR7           |
| Action/dismiss controls | Keep their own Button painting and target ownership.                                               | Current composition            | Supporting     | FR7                |

The Banner frame is stable anatomy and owns the additive `banner-frame` target.
The Status surface remains Banner's primary painted surface and keeps the
unqualified `banner` target.

### Theming anatomy

<!-- anatomy-theming:v1 -->

```json
{
  "Banner frame": {"target": "banner-frame"},
  "Status surface": {"target": "banner"},
  "Icon": {"target": "banner-icon"},
  "Title": {"inherits": "banner"},
  "Description": {"target": "banner-description"},
  "Action button": {
    "delegatesTo": {"owner": "component:Button", "target": "button"}
  },
  "Dismiss button": {
    "delegatesTo": {"owner": "component:Button", "target": "button"}
  },
  "Content surface": {"target": "banner-content"}
}
```

This map records runtime reachability. `banner` belongs to the primary Status
surface rather than the outermost DOM element, while `banner-frame` belongs to
the visible frame that owns whole-banner elevation and silhouette.

## Family and system relationships

- `architecture:component-theming-surface` owns target qualification, anatomy
  mapping, and the requirement that public targets sit on stable painted parts.
- `architecture:public-component-api` governs compatibility for the additive
  target admitted by DEC-1.
- `architecture:theme-compilation` owns the private derived-variable route that
  currently carries Banner radius across its painters.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — The Banner frame has separate public theme ownership

**Reference:** `component:Banner/DEC-1`

**Decider:** cixzhang, 2026-09-07

The Banner frame is stable visible anatomy that owns whole-banner elevation and
the elevated-card silhouette across the Status and optional Content surfaces.
It receives the additive `banner-frame` target with `container` and `elevation`
selector axes. The existing `banner` target remains on the primary Status
surface.

`frame` names the public visual role. `root` is rejected because it describes DOM
placement and would imply that the target must remain on the outermost element.
