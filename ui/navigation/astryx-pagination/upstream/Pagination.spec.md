# Pagination component contract

## Intent

Pagination presents controls for moving through pages and may let people choose a
page size or enter a page directly. This draft records its current consumer
anatomy, four local theming targets, delegated control ownership, and current
unreached Ellipsis without changing runtime behavior, styling, targets, or public
API.

## Compatibility and migration

- Released default preserved: `yes`
- Compatibility class: additive documentation only; runtime, DOM, styling,
  targets, aliases, and public API remain unchanged
- Controlled/uncontrolled behavior: unchanged
- Migration decision: none

Consumer migration instructions belong in consumer docs and release notes.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- The Pagination navigation landmark and its current `pagination` target.
- The Dot, Page input label, and Page input total parts and their current
  `pagination-dot`, `pagination-input-label`, and `pagination-input-total`
  targets.
- Choosing which stable controls and readouts render for the current paging
  configuration.

**Does not own / non-goals**

- Button, Text, NumberInput, or Selector presentation and targets; those remain
  owned by their respective components.
- Button icon artwork or other internals of delegated controls.
- A public target for Ellipsis; none exists on current `main`.
- New paging behavior, variants, state, public API, or theming targets.

## Public concepts

No new public concept is introduced. Consumer props, presentations, defaults,
and usage remain documented in `Pagination.doc.mjs`.

## Behavioral and layout contract

| ID  | Candidate invariant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Basis                                  | Draft review state                                                        |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FR1 | The current render contains one Pagination landmark and Previous/next buttons. Page-size selector, First/last buttons, Page number buttons, Ellipsis, Count readout, Compact readout, Dots, Page input label, Page input, and Page input total appear only when their existing conditions are met. | Current source, docs, and tests        | Verified current behavior; no new behavior decided                        |
| FR2 | Pagination, Dot, Page input label, and Page input total carry the four current local targets `pagination`, `pagination-dot`, `pagination-input-label`, and `pagination-input-total`.                                                                                                               | Current source, docs, and history      | Verified current inventory; focused placement coverage is absent          |
| FR3 | Page-size selector delegates to Selector; First/last, Previous/next, and Page number buttons delegate to Button; Count and Compact readouts delegate to Text; Page input delegates to NumberInput.                                                                                                 | Current source and owner evidence      | Verified current ownership; no target change                              |
| FR4 | Ellipsis is stable visible Pagination-rendered content in a numbered presentation and currently carries no public target.                                                                                                                                                                          | Current source, tests, and target docs | Verified current reachability; long-term theming intent remains unsettled |

### Allowed variation

- **AV1 — Paging data.** Current page, total pages, total items, page size, and
  stride may vary without changing anatomy ownership.
- **AV2 — Presentation.** Existing presentation selection changes which optional
  stable parts are present; presentation names and runtime states are not anatomy.
- **AV3 — Delegated rendering.** Button, Text, NumberInput, and Selector may
  change internal element shape while preserving their own public contracts.

### Representative states

| State                         | Required invariant                                                                | Allowed variation                                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Numbered, known page count    | Page number buttons render; Ellipsis appears only where pages are omitted.        | Page count, sibling range, and active page.        |
| Count with known item total   | Count readout renders between Previous/next buttons.                              | Range and total text.                              |
| Compact with known page count | Compact readout renders between Previous/next buttons.                            | Current and total page text.                       |
| Dots with known page count    | One Dot renders for each page and active state stays on the Dot target.           | Dot count and active Dot.                          |
| Input with known page count   | Page input label, Page input, and Page input total render; First/last may render. | Label text and first/last opt-out.                 |
| Input with unknown page count | Page input label and disabled Page input remain; total and First/last are absent. | Cursor-backed current page.                        |
| None                          | Previous/next buttons remain without a presentation-specific part between them.   | Enabled state follows current paging availability. |

The optional Page-size selector may precede the paging controls in any current
presentation when page-size options are provided.

### Transformation and precedence order

- No new page calculation, range generation, optimistic update, or styling
  precedence rule is introduced.

### Performance and resources

- No new performance or resource rule is introduced.

## Accessibility contract

This draft does not change or extend Pagination's existing navigation landmark,
button naming, current-page semantics, roving Dot focus, live announcements, or
input bounds.

## Design relationships

| Anatomy or state      | Design requirement                                                 | Representation authority       | Hierarchy role | Component contract |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Pagination            | Groups the page-size and paging controls in a navigation landmark. | Current source and public docs | Supporting     | FR1, FR2           |
| Page-size selector    | Lets people choose the number of items shown per page.             | `component:Selector`           | Supporting     | FR1, FR3           |
| First/last buttons    | Jump directly to the first or last known page.                     | `component:Button`             | Supporting     | FR1, FR3           |
| Previous/next buttons | Move backward or forward through pages.                            | `component:Button`             | Prominent      | FR1, FR3           |
| Page number button    | Selects one page directly in the numbered presentation.            | `component:Button`             | Prominent      | FR1, FR3           |
| Ellipsis              | Indicates an omitted span of page numbers.                         | Current source and public docs | Supporting     | FR1, FR4           |
| Count readout         | Presents the visible item range and total.                         | `component:Text`               | Prominent      | FR1, FR3           |
| Compact readout       | Presents the current and total page counts.                        | `component:Text`               | Prominent      | FR1, FR3           |
| Dot                   | Presents and selects one page in the dot presentation.             | Current source and public docs | Prominent      | FR1, FR2           |
| Page input label      | Names the editable page field visually.                            | Current source and public docs | Supporting     | FR1, FR2           |
| Page input            | Accepts a direct page-number entry.                                | `component:NumberInput`        | Prominent      | FR1, FR3           |
| Page input total      | Presents the known total after the editable page field.            | Current source and public docs | Supporting     | FR1, FR2           |

The three Button rows are separate stable controls with different conditions and
jobs; they do not create Pagination-owned Button targets. Presentation values,
size, disabled state, and active state remain capabilities on owning targets,
not anatomy entries.

### Theming anatomy

<!-- anatomy-theming:v1 -->

```json
{
  "Pagination": {"target": "pagination"},
  "Page-size selector": {
    "delegatesTo": {"owner": "component:Selector", "target": "selector"}
  },
  "First/last buttons": {
    "delegatesTo": {"owner": "component:Button", "target": "button"}
  },
  "Previous/next buttons": {
    "delegatesTo": {"owner": "component:Button", "target": "button"}
  },
  "Page number button": {
    "delegatesTo": {"owner": "component:Button", "target": "button"}
  },
  "Ellipsis": {
    "none": {
      "reason": "unsettled: no current public target is applied to the Pagination-rendered ellipsis"
    }
  },
  "Count readout": {
    "delegatesTo": {"owner": "component:Text", "target": "text"}
  },
  "Compact readout": {
    "delegatesTo": {"owner": "component:Text", "target": "text"}
  },
  "Dot": {"target": "pagination-dot"},
  "Page input label": {"target": "pagination-input-label"},
  "Page input": {
    "delegatesTo": {"owner": "component:NumberInput", "target": "number-input"}
  },
  "Page input total": {"target": "pagination-input-total"}
}
```

The four local targets are current public seams. Delegated controls retain their
component owners. Ellipsis has no current target; that factual `none` disposition
does not decide whether it should remain unreachable.

## Family and system relationships

- `architecture:component-theming-surface` owns anatomy qualification, local
  target mapping, delegation, state placement, and factual `none` dispositions.
- Button, Text, NumberInput, and Selector retain ownership of their delegated
  targets and presentation.

Pagination has broad behavior coverage but no focused assertions for placement
of its four local target classes. Delegated owner tests pin the owner targets;
Pagination tests pin that the corresponding controls render, not their target
class composition.

## Decision log

None. This draft records current facts and introduces no component-local design,
API, behavior, or theming decision.

## Open questions

- **OQ1 — Which focused tests should pin placement and reflected properties for
  the four local Pagination targets?** (`checkable`)
- **OQ2 — Should Ellipsis gain a stable public theming target?** (`human-api`)
  Its current lack of reachability is an audit gap, not settled intent.

## Content boundary

This file does not duplicate consumer prop tables/examples, paging algorithms,
implementation steps, owner-component internals, or system theming rules. It
links to their owners.
