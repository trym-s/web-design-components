# Selector component contract

## Intent

Selector lets a person choose one value from a moderate list while keeping the
trigger usable as a form field or compact toolbar control. It owns single-value
selection, option navigation, search within the supplied options, and the
connection between the closed trigger and its selection surface.

## Compatibility and migration

- Released defaults and behavior remain unchanged by this record.
- `indicatorPosition` defaults to `end`; a rendered selection mark occupies
  space at that logical edge, while an empty resolved indicator occupies none.
- `presentation` defaults to `popover`. `bottom-sheet` is an explicit modal
  presentation, and `adaptive` selects it on compact coarse-pointer screens.
- `hasClear` changes the value contract to include `null`; that distinction is
  already part of the public type.
- `isReadOnly` is additive and defaults to `false`. It preserves the selected
  value, focus, and form participation while removing selection-surface and
  editing affordances. `isDisabled` takes precedence when both are set.
- `spec:AST-004/DEC-1` governs the state-derived indicator-space behavior in FR3.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- Choosing one value from supplied options.
- Trigger, listbox, option, search, empty, loading, and disabled behavior.
- Keyboard navigation and announcements for that selection flow.
- Selector-specific composition of shared Field, Layer, adaptive presentation,
  and indicator behavior.

**Does not own / non-goals**

- Action or navigation menus; DropdownMenu owns those.
- Multi-value selection; MultiSelector owns it.
- Product-specific option content or filtering performed outside the supplied
  option list.
- Family-wide input state display, behavior, appearance, size, end-control,
  status-placement, and disabled-reason policy — owned by current
  `family:input-fields`.

## Public concepts

This table names semantic concepts reviewers need. Prop syntax, complete defaults,
and examples remain in `Selector.doc.mjs`.

## Behavioral and layout contract

These requirements describe shipped behavior on current `main`.

| ID  | Shipped invariant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Evidence                                                                 |

| FR1 | Selecting an enabled option updates the one selected value, closes the active presentation, and returns the trigger to its stable closed state.                                                                                                                                                                               | Consumer docs and selection interaction tests                            |
| FR2 | Without explicit placement, a non-search popover aligns the selected row over the trigger and clamps it to the viewport. Search popovers and explicit placement use normal Layer positioning.                                                                                                                                 | Consumer docs, implementation, and geometry tests                        |
| FR3 | An option whose resolved selection indicator draws no content reserves no mark-column space. Visible selected or themed replacement indicators remain in layout at `indicatorPosition`; the resulting state-dependent label position or available width is intentional, and row content keeps its existing overflow behavior. | `itemMarkColumn`, focused indicator tests, and Chromium evidence stories |
| FR4 | `popover` uses an anchored Popover. `bottom-sheet` uses a modal BottomSheet. `adaptive` resolves to the modal bottom sheet on compact coarse-pointer screens and Popover otherwise.                                                                                                                                           | Presentation controller and adaptive-presentation tests                  |
| FR5 | While `isLoading` is true, the trigger exposes busy state and the listbox suppresses empty and no-results output.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Loading, empty-state, and announcement tests                             |
| FR6 | While `isReadOnly` is true, the selected value remains focusable and form-submittable, while the selection surface, clear action, disclosure indicator, and every value-change path are unavailable.                                                                                                                          | Read-only interaction, form, and accessibility tests                     |

### Allowed variation

- **AV1 — Indicator rendering.** A theme may replace the check indicator. A
  replacement that draws in both selected and unselected states keeps its mark
  space in both states; only resolved empty output collapses.
- **AV2 — Option content.** `renderOption` may replace visible option content,
  while Selector keeps row role, selection, disabled state, navigation, and
  theming state.
- **AV3 — Selected value content.** `renderValue` may replace the closed value
  display without changing its combobox identity, whether editable or read-only.

### Representative states

| State                    | Required invariant                                                                        | Allowed variation                                          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| closed with no value     | Label and placeholder identify the field                                                  | Consumer placeholder text                                  |
| closed with a value      | Selected option is represented in the trigger                                             | Custom `renderValue` content                               |
| pointer / popover        | Anchored surface exposes the listbox without modal-dialog semantics                       | Default or explicit placement                              |
| compact coarse pointer   | BottomSheet exposes a modal dialog containing the listbox                                 | Explicit `bottom-sheet` or resolved `adaptive`             |
| searching                | Visible options, keyboard navigation, and announced result count use one filter           | Consumer search and empty text                             |
| loading                  | Trigger is busy; empty and no-results output is suppressed                                | Consumer loading duration                                  |
| disabled with reason     | Trigger remains focusable enough to expose the reason while activation stays blocked      | Consumer reason text                                       |
| read-only                | Value stays focusable and submittable; menu, clear, and disclosure affordances are absent | Value rendering, status, and busy presentation             |
| selected/unselected rows | Empty marks consume no width; visible marks retain space at the logical edge              | State-dependent label position/width and themed indicators |

### Transformation and precedence order

- **ORD1 — Option normalization precedes filtering and selection.** Strings and
  option objects become one option shape before search, keyboard matching,
  rendering, and value comparison.
- **ORD2 — Caller-selected content wins deliberately.** `startIcon` takes
  precedence over a selected option's icon; explicit placement takes precedence
  over selected-item overlay alignment.

### Performance and resources

- **PR1 — Search does not add effect-driven result-count renders.** The next
  filtered count is derived from the input change and announced once for that
  query.
- **PR2 — Geometry work is scoped to the open popover.** Selected-item alignment
  may read browser layout while opening; it does not impose document-wide or
  persistent observation while closed.

## Accessibility contract

- **AR1 — Semantics follow presentation.** The anchored presentation exposes a
  listbox through a Popover and the trigger uses `aria-haspopup="listbox"`. The
  touch presentation exposes a modal BottomSheet dialog containing the listbox
  and the trigger uses `aria-haspopup="dialog"`.
- **AR2 — Focus follows the active interaction model.** The anchored presentation
  keeps the combobox relationship at the trigger/search control. The modal touch
  presentation moves focus into its search control or listbox and restores focus
  to the trigger when it closes.
- **AR3 — Keyboard selection matches the visible set.** Arrow, Home/End,
  typeahead, search, Enter, Escape, and Tab behavior operate on the options a
  person can currently perceive.
- **AR4 — Read-only semantics match availability.** A read-only value stays
  focusable, retains `role="combobox"`, and exposes `aria-readonly="true"` plus
  `aria-expanded="false"`. Its rendered content remains the combobox value. It
  does not expose `aria-controls`, `aria-activedescendant`, or an active selection
  surface. The implicit listbox popup describes the widget's selection capability;
  read-only state communicates that its value cannot currently change. Chromium's
  button-hosted combobox mapping omits the ARIA read-only property, so a localized
  accessible description also announces that state. Search and non-search modes
  use the same read-only combobox semantics because neither exposes a search
  control in this state.

## Design relationships

No current design spec is linked.

`Field` is conditional: standalone Selector renders it, while InputGroup owns
that surrounding shell. `Pointer popup` and the two touch-sheet parts are
alternative presentations of the same panel content, not simultaneous anatomy.
Icon-rendered start content delegates to Icon; arbitrary `ReactNode` start content
is caller-owned. The default renderer and custom `renderOption` functions that
return `SelectorOption` retain its target; only bare caller-rendered option
content stays outside that target, while the targeted option row remains.
`selector-clear-icon` remains a deprecated compatibility alias and does not own a
current anatomy row.

This map records only shipped reachability. It does not treat the accepted,
unimplemented option-source behavior in `spec:AST-001` as current runtime behavior.
`spec:AST-004` governs FR3's shipped indicator-space behavior without adding a
new theming target.

## Family and system relationships

- The current architecture links in frontmatter own public API, theming, icon
  resolution, interaction modality, and Layer behavior used by Selector.
- `spec:AST-004/DEC-1` owns FR3's shipped indicator-space behavior.
- `spec:AST-011/DEC-1` owns the additive read-only state: caller-owned policy can
  preserve a focusable, submittable value without exposing selection controls.
- `family:input-fields` owns family-wide state display, behavior, appearance,
  size, end-control, disabled-reason, and status-placement policy. Selector
  keeps its DEC-1 standalone inline-size exception; this component contract
  owns selection behavior inside that boundary.
