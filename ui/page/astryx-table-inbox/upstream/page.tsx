/**
 * A triage queue where the row is the control surface: hovering it swaps the
 * timestamp for four actions, clicking it opens the thread in a reading pane.
 *
 * An inbox is a table whose rows are verbs. Nobody sorts an inbox by sender or
 * compares one row against the next — they scan for the thread that matters and
 * then do something to it. So the columns are here to hold sender, subject,
 * tags, and time in the same place on every row, which is what makes the list
 * scannable at all, and everything else in the template is about acting on a
 * row without leaving the list.
 *
 * ## Extending this template
 *
 * **The hover swap is CSS, and it has to be.** Four buttons take the
 * timestamp's place while the pointer is on the row. The obvious build —
 * `onMouseEnter` writing a `hoveredId` — re-renders the table on every row the
 * cursor crosses, and gets the accessibility wrong in three separate ways.
 * `useContainerReveal` is the primitive for it: the container publishes its
 * hover state as inherited custom properties and the content reads them, so the
 * swap costs no React state and no re-render. Keyboard focus reveals the
 * actions with no dwell to wait through, coarse pointers get them permanently
 * (they are never behind a hover a touch user cannot perform), and the buttons
 * stay mounted and tabbable at rest rather than being `display: none`.
 *
 * The container is the `<tr>` and the content is inside a `<td>`, which works
 * because the scoping is inheritance rather than a selector — see
 * `useInboxRows`, where the container props are merged onto the row.
 * `hoverDelay` is the other half: without a dwell, dragging the cursor down the
 * list lights up all nine rows in sequence.
 *
 * **Read/unread is the row-status plugin, and that decided the whole file.**
 * `useTableRowStatus` renders a status gutter, and plugins that render only run
 * in data-driven mode — passing `children` replaces the entire header-and-body
 * render, so a hand-composed table gets no plugin cells at all. Data mode in
 * turn always renders a header when columns are defined. A headerless inbox and
 * a plugin-driven one are mutually exclusive today; this template takes the
 * plugins, and the header earns its place by labelling the sort affordances.
 *
 * **Two washes cannot share the row's inline style.** The selection plugin
 * writes `el.style.backgroundColor` imperatively on every notify, so an
 * open-row background set in `transformBodyRow` gets wiped the next time
 * selection changes. `hasRowHighlight: false` turns the plugin's wash off —
 * it exists for exactly this case — and the open row is painted on its
 * *cells* instead, which nothing else touches.
 *
 * **Selecting must never open the thread.** Two activation surfaces overlap on
 * every row: the row opens it, the checkbox and the four actions do not. The
 * tempting fix is `stopPropagation` on each inner control, and it fails on the
 * one that matters — the checkbox belongs to the selection plugin, so there is
 * no handler here to hang it on, and ticking a box opens the reading pane.
 * `isRowItself` guards from the row instead, which covers the plugin's markup
 * and anything added later, on click and on Space alike.
 *
 * **The reading pane is a layout slot, not an overlay.** `LayoutPanel` in
 * `Layout`'s `end` slot is a flex sibling, so opening it narrows the table
 * rather than covering it — which is why `tags` drops out of the column list
 * while the pane is open. A `Dialog` would trap focus and make triaging a queue
 * a modal act, which is the opposite of what an inbox is for.
 *
 * **Reply drafts are scoped to their thread.** Closing the composer preserves an
 * unfinished draft, and reopening Reply on the same conversation restores it.
 * Starting a reply on a different conversation clears the body, Cc, and Bcc
 * state before changing recipients, so no part of one customer's draft can be
 * sent to another.

 * to two different triggers: reveal comes in on `:focus-within` so a keyboard
 * user can reach it, and conceal deliberately ignores focus, because nobody
 * should watch text vanish as they tab into a row. Click a row — which leaves
 * it focused — and both fired at once, on top of each other. Here there is no
 * second rule to disagree with the first. The timestamp is not hidden, it is
 * displaced, and no state exists in which the actions hold the cell and the
 * timestamp still has width to be seen in.
 *
 * The cost is real and worth naming: while the row holds focus the date is not
 * readable. It stays in the accessibility tree — clipped, never `display:
 * none` — the pane carries `receivedFull`, and the alternative is the empty

           the things on its ends to be buttons, and lets their padding make up
           the difference. It reads that container figure from a CSS custom
           property no template can set, but a plain Stack does not republish
           the property, so a Stack's padding simply adds on top.

           The two ends then need different amounts, because only one of them
           is a button. The title is a Heading with no side bearing at all, so
           it needs the larger share to reach 24px. The close button carries
           its own, so the same amount would push its glyph past the line the
           text is on. 12 and 8 put both on it.

           The top works the same way and lands on the same 24px: the toolbar
           already holds 8 of its own, so 16 here tops it up rather than
           replacing it. The body below starts at 0, so this is the only top

 * and never locks body scroll: the inbox behind it stays live. That matters
 * more here than anywhere else in this template, because writing a message is
 * exactly when someone needs to go back and read one — check what a customer
 * actually said, copy an order number out of a thread. A modal composer
 * answers that with "close me first".
 *
 * The trade is position, and it is worth naming. A sheet rises from the bottom
 * edge, centred: its positioner is `inset-inline: 0` with
 * `justify-content: center`, and there is no anchor, side or width prop. So
 * this cannot be docked to the inline-end corner the way a `Dialog` can be.
 * `Dialog` takes a static `position` and would put the window in that corner —
 * but `Dialog` is always modal, so buying the corner costs the live inbox.
 * `ChatComposerDrawer` is a false friend: despite the name it is an in-flow
 * disclosure tray for a ChatComposer's attachments, with no positioning of its
 * own.
 *
 * **`purpose="form"` is doing real work.** The default, `info`, dismisses on a
 * scrim tap *and on a downward swipe*, either of which throws a half-written
 * message away by accident. `form` blocks both and keeps Escape and the close
 * button. It is worth setting even with no scrim to render, because the swipe
 * is still live.
 *
 * Focus is not hand-rolled. The sheet focuses whichever descendant carries
 * `data-autofocus` once it is actually visible — React's own `autoFocus` fires

                   deliberate, short-lived mode, and the bucket you are in is
                   still named by the heading above and the rows themselves.
                   Clearing the selection puts the tabs straight back.

                   The band itself is `table-filter`'s, down to the muted fill,
                   the radius and the `@starting-style` rise on entry, and it
                   runs full-bleed there too — so it lands on exactly the
                   footprint the tab strip's rail just vacated. The fill is
                   what separates it from the rows, which is why nothing draws
                   a rule under it.

                   The *slot* is pinned to `SELECTION_BAR_HEIGHT`, and only the
                   slot: that is the part the table can feel, so that is the
                   part that must not move. The band inside it is free to be
                   taller than the strip it replaces — 8px above and below the
                   buttons, which is what stops a bar made of ghost buttons
                   from reading as a row of loose glyphs — and the surplus is
                   sent upward by aligning it to the bottom of the slot, so it
                   laps into the header's own padding rather than over the
                   first row. Bottom-aligned rather than centred for that
                   reason alone; centring would split the overflow and put half

                edge. `isReversed` is the other half of that: the hook grows a
                region as the pointer travels toward inline-end, and this one

                place, so leaving it on both draws it twice.

                divider and pushed a grip-width clear of it, and the grab zone
                travels with it rather than staying on the line. `end` puts
