   * via Escape or light dismiss drops keyboard focus to `<body>`.

   * The restore is guarded so it never steals focus a consumer moved on

   * now-unmounted) trap container. If focus already moved to some other element
   * outside the trap (the user clicked elsewhere, or a consumer such as
   * DropdownMenu already refocused its trigger), the restore is a no-op.
   *
   * The restore is also skipped when focus never entered the trap while it
   * was active. Some popups — a Typeahead/PowerSearch listbox anchored to its
   * own input — deliberately keep DOM focus on the trigger and never move it
   * into the trap container (they open with `role: "none"` and
   * `hasAutoFocus: false`). For those, the restore would cancel a blur the
   * user asked for on outside-click dismissal, re-focusing the trigger so a
   * second click no longer fires a `focus` event and cannot reopen the menu.
   * Tracking `focusin` inside the container distinguishes "focus was here and
   * we should rescue it" from "focus was never here and we should leave it
   * alone" — popups that do take focus (Dialog, DropdownMenu, a Typeahead
   * option click) are unaffected.
