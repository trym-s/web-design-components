    'A guided product tour (NUX / onboarding). Tour is a controller that steps a user through a sequence of spotlight callouts anchored to elements on the page. It renders no chrome itself; it owns the active-step state and shares it with declaratively-nested TourStep children (step order follows the children). Experimental: lands in lab first (facebook/astryx#4239).',
