 * @file scrollbarGutter.ts
 * @input The element a scroll lock pins, plus live layout measurements
 * @output Exports holdScrollbarGutter and the ScrollbarGutterHold it returns
 * @position Internal hook utility; used by useScrollLock and MobileNav so that
 *   locking background scroll does not resize the layout viewport.
 *
 * Locking scroll hides the document's scrollbar. Where that scrollbar is a
 * classic (space-taking) one — Windows/Linux desktop, and macOS set to
 * "Always" show scroll bars — hiding it widens the layout viewport by the
 * scrollbar's width and the whole page jumps sideways behind the overlay.
 *
 * The fix is `scrollbar-gutter: stable`, which holds the gutter open once the
 * scrollbar goes away. Being a real layout change it holds `position: fixed`
 * chrome (sticky headers, toast viewports) as well as in-flow content, which
 * padding fundamentally cannot: fixed elements resolve against the viewport,
 * not against the padded element.
 *
 * Padding is kept only as a fallback for engines without `scrollbar-gutter`
 * (Safari shipped it in 18.2), and it is applied by measuring whether the
 * element actually moved rather than by assuming it did.
