 * @file TouchDateField.tsx
 * @input Uses React, Field, BottomSheet, Button, Icon, Calendar hooks, MonthScroller, MonthYearWheels
 * @output Exports TouchDateField — the touch surface behind DateInput
 * @position Internal component; consumed by DateInput.tsx
 *
 * The touch half of `DateInput`, holding `DateInput`'s whole prop
 * contract so the two are interchangeable. Everything field-shaped —
 * `Field` wrapper, status treatment, optimistic `changeAction`, the
 * disabled-reason tooltip, `InputGroup` membership — behaves exactly as it
 * does on the desktop control; only the picker differs.
 *
 * ## The closed field is deliberately the same control
 *
 * It is a real `<input>`, not a button: same element, same `role="combobox"`,
 * same border, same clear button, so `ref` (typed `Ref<HTMLInputElement>` by
 * `DateInputProps`) is honestly a reference to an input, the label's `for`
 * names it natively, and the switch between surfaces moves nothing on screen.
 *
 * It just cannot be typed into: `readOnly` blocks entry, and `inputMode="none"`
 * stops the virtual keyboard from opening over the sheet. Text entry is the
 * one part of the desktop control that has no place here — the keyboard it
 * summons would cover the picker it is meant to fill in.
 *
 * ## Three ideas in the picker
 *
 * 1. One month per screen. Every pane is exactly the height of the scrollport
 *    and snaps to its start, so the picker is a fixed height and there is no
 *    resting position showing half of two months. See MonthScroller.
 * 2. Swiping is the month control, and the arrows are the backup. A flick
 *    reaches a neighbouring month in the direction you already think of it;
 *    the pair of arrows in the header's trailing corner is there for a
 *    deliberate single step, and for anyone not swiping at all.
 * 3. The title is the escape hatch. Tap it and the same box becomes a month
 *    wheel and a year wheel — a flick each to reach 2019 instead of forty.
 *
 * Reset is chrome, so it sits in the header beside the arrows rather than in
 * the footer: the footer is where the task ends, and an undo of equal weight
 * beside Save is a mis-tap that throws away the date just chosen.
 *
 * SYNC: When modified, update these files to stay in sync:
 * - /packages/core/src/DateInput/DateInput.tsx
 * - /packages/core/src/DateInput/DateInput.doc.mjs
 * - /packages/core/src/DateInput/DateInputTouch.test.tsx

   * The month and year, as one layer that fades in and out on top.
   *
   * The calendar underneath does not fade with it — this layer is opaque, so
   * covering it is enough, and animating it too would be animating the date
   * picker rather than the thing arriving over it.
   *
   * Three properties carry the whole design:
   *
   * `backgroundColor` is what makes the fade uniform. Without it the wheels
   * are a translucent selection band and some text, each compositing against
   * a live calendar grid on its own terms — so the band area faded unlike the
   * rest and read as "the grey area animates differently from the content".
   * With the plate inside the fading group, the group renders opaque first
   * and the fade applies to the finished image, so every pixel of it crosses
   * at the same rate.
   *
   * `isolation` is what makes the plate actually cover. Backgrounds and text
   * paint in separate phases, so without a stacking context a later sibling's
   * background lands UNDER an earlier sibling's text — the plate went in
   * opaque and the calendar's day numbers showed straight through it. Easy to
   * lose, because any opacity below 1 makes a stacking context anyway: the
   * cover only breaks at the two ends of the fade, where opacity is exactly
   * 1, which is to say whenever anyone is actually looking.
   *
   * `visibility` rides along with `opacity`, on the same rule as the layer
   * beneath: it stays `visible` for the whole transition, so fading out is
   * seen rather than cut on the first frame, and the layer still leaves the
   * a11y tree and the hit testing at the end of it.
   *
   * Easing is `linear`, not `--ease-standard`. That token is
   * `cubic-bezier(0.24, 1, 0.4, 1)`, which is right for something travelling
   * a distance and wrong for a fade: measured, it put the opacity at 50% in
   * 91ms and 95% in 241ms of a 410ms transition, so the fade was over long
   * before the duration was, and lengthening the duration bought an
   * imperceptible tail rather than a slower fade. A fade has no distance to
   * cover, so its progress should be its progress.
