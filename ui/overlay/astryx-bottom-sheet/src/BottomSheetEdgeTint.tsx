/**
 * @file BottomSheetEdgeTint.tsx
 * @input Uses StyleX and core color tokens
 * @output Exports BottomSheetEdgeTint, an internal decorative element
 * @position Private helper rendered inside every BottomSheet dialog
 *
 * iOS 26 Safari dropped `<meta name="theme-color">` and instead derives the
 * colour it paints behind its translucent toolbars by sampling the page: it
 * hit tests a point just inside each viewport edge, walks up to the nearest
 * `fixed`/`sticky` ancestor, and extends that element's declared
 * `background-color` into the browser chrome.
 *
 * WebKit may otherwise extend either the dialog backdrop or the host page into
 * the browser chrome. Which one wins varies with dialog mode and the page's
 * own fixed or sticky edge content, so relying on the backdrop makes otherwise
 * identical BottomSheets produce different toolbar colours.
 *
 * This element gives the heuristic something unambiguous to sample: fixed,
 * full width, flush with the bottom edge, taller than WebKit's 10px minimum
 * for reading a declared colour, and painted in the sheet's own surface
 * colour. It is masked out so it never renders for the user; Safari reads the
 * computed style, not the painted pixels.
 *
 * Everywhere else it is inert decoration.
 *
 * SYNC: When modified, update these files to stay in sync:
 * - /packages/core/src/BottomSheet/BottomSheet.tsx
 * - /packages/core/src/BottomSheet/BottomSheetSwitcher.tsx
 * - /packages/core/src/BottomSheet/BottomSheetEdgeTint.test.tsx
