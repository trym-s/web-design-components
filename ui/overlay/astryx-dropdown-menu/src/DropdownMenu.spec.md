# DropdownMenu component contract

## Intent

DropdownMenu presents actions from a visible Button trigger in either an
anchored pointer menu or a BottomSheet-hosted touch action list. This draft
records current consumer anatomy, presentation-specific ownership, and theming
reachability without changing runtime behavior, styling, targets, or public API.

## Compatibility and migration

- Released default preserved: `yes`
- Compatibility class: additive documentation only; runtime, DOM, styling,
  targets, and public API remain unchanged
- Controlled/uncontrolled behavior: unchanged
- Migration decision: none

Consumer migration instructions belong in consumer docs and release notes.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- The Pointer menu surface and Touch menu surface and their shared current
  `dropdown-menu` target.
- Pointer action rows, pointer-only section headings and dividers, radio marker
  specialization, and submenu indicator presentation through the other five
  current DropdownMenu targets.
- Selecting between the current pointer and touch render paths after presentation
  policy resolves.

**Does not own / non-goals**

- Trigger-button presentation — delegated to `component:Button`.
- The Touch sheet frame — delegated to `component:BottomSheet`.
- Touch action-list and row presentation — delegated to `component:List`.
- Shared checkbox-indicator and ordinary icon presentation — delegated to
  `component:Indicator` and `component:Icon`.
- Shared layer lifecycle or dismissal policy.

## Public concepts

No new public concept is introduced. Consumer props, item shapes,
subcomponents, and presentation policy remain documented in
`DropdownMenu.doc.mjs` and the subcomponent docs.

## Behavioral and layout contract

| ID  | Candidate invariant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Basis                           | Draft review state                                 |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| FR1 | Every current render contains a Trigger button. Pointer presentation renders a Pointer menu surface with pointer-owned rows and optional pointer headings, dividers, indicators, and nested flyouts. Touch presentation renders a Touch sheet frame containing a Touch menu surface, Touch heading, Touch action list, and Touch action rows. | Current source, docs, and tests | Verified current behavior; no new behavior decided |
| FR2 | The six current local targets are `dropdown-menu`, `dropdown-menu-item`, `dropdown-menu-radio`, `dropdown-menu-section-heading`, `dropdown-menu-divider`, and `dropdown-menu-indicator-icon`; every target remains on its current painted element.                                                                                            | Current source, docs, and tests | Verified current inventory; no target change       |
| FR3 | Button owns the Trigger button, BottomSheet owns the Touch sheet frame, List owns the Touch action list and Touch action rows, Indicator owns checkbox chrome, and Icon owns ordinary rendered icons.                                                                                                                                         | Current source and owner docs   | Verified current delegation; no ownership change   |
| FR4 | The same `dropdown-menu` target reaches the alternative Pointer menu surface and Touch menu surface. Pointer action rows retain `dropdown-menu-item`; touch action rows instead use List's `list-item` target.                                                                                                                                | Current source and tests        | Verified modality split; no target change          |

### Allowed variation

- **AV1 — Presentation.** `popover`, `bottom-sheet`, and resolved `adaptive`
  presentation may select the current pointer or touch anatomy without changing
  the ownership of either branch.
- **AV2 — Content mode.** Data-driven and compound pointer menus may vary their
  rows while preserving the current target owners. Touch presentation remains
  data-driven.
- **AV3 — Optional content.** Icons, selectable indicators, headings, dividers,
  and nested actions render only when the supplied menu content requires them.

### Representative states

| State                       | Required invariant                                                                                 | Allowed variation                                              |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Anchored root menu          | Trigger button and Pointer menu surface render with pointer-owned rows.                            | Width, placement, alignment, and optional item content vary.   |
| Anchored nested flyout      | Pointer action row opens another Pointer menu surface and may show the submenu indicator icon.     | Loading may replace the indicator with the current Spinner.    |
| Bottom-sheet root actions   | Trigger button opens Touch sheet frame, Touch menu surface, heading, action list, and action rows. | Icons, sections, dividers, and action descriptions may vary.   |
| Bottom-sheet nested actions | The same frame and list owners remain while heading and rows change to the selected action level.  | Back control and drill-in indicator follow current navigation. |
| Selectable pointer action   | Pointer action row may contain shared checkbox or radio chrome.                                    | Checked and disabled state follow the current item contracts.  |

### Transformation and precedence order

- No new presentation-resolution, open-state, item-rendering, positioning, or
  styling precedence rule is introduced.

### Performance and resources

- No new loading, listener, measurement, or render constraint is introduced.

## Accessibility contract

This draft does not change or extend DropdownMenu's existing trigger naming,
menu and dialog roles, focus movement, keyboard navigation, item semantics, or
dismissal behavior.

## Design relationships

| Anatomy or state                   | Design requirement                                                            | Representation authority       | Hierarchy role    | Component contract |

The `dropdown-menu` target intentionally appears on both alternative menu
surfaces. The radio element also carries Indicator's shared radio target, and
the pointer divider also carries Divider's target; their local targets remain
valid distinct contracts. Touch headings retain the shared `heading` target documented by Text rather
than adding a DropdownMenu-owned heading target.

## Family and system relationships

- `architecture:component-theming-surface` owns anatomy qualification, local
  target mapping, presentation-specific rows, and delegation rules.
- `architecture:interaction-modality` owns the shared pointer, touch, keyboard,
  and adaptive-presentation boundaries; this draft changes none of them.
- `architecture:layer-runtime` owns the current `usePopover` host, native
  light-dismiss reconciliation, anchor positioning, and nested `useLayer`
  flyouts. Touch presentation delegates hosting to BottomSheet.
- `family:overlay-dismissal` owns shared Escape and platform-close ordering.
  DropdownMenu root participates through its Popover focus trap; the composed
  BottomSheet and DropdownMenuSubMenu retain their recorded local-only adoption
  gaps.
