# TabList component contract

## Contract at a glance

| Area                    | Contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public contract         | Canonicalize the existing alignment mode as `edgeCompensation?: 'inline'`; deprecate `isFullBleed` and remove it in the next minor release.                                                                                                                                        |
| Behavior                | Move first and last visible tab content toward the host content line, reaching it when the host inset is at least the edge-tab padding, while preserving tab interaction padding, focus-ring room, overflow controls, selection-indicator geometry, and the optional divider rail. |
| End-user impact         | Edge tabs lose unnecessary extra inset where host geometry permits and remain fully interactive without clipped focus, selection, overflow, or divider treatment.                                                                                                                  |
| Builder impact          | Existing `isFullBleed` callsites keep working during the deprecation window and migrate mechanically to `edgeCompensation="inline"`.                                                                                                                                               |
| Compatibility/readiness | Current behavior is shipped; the canonical alias is additive, while removing the released legacy prop is a separately implemented breaking change in the next minor release.                                                                                                       |
| Review checks           | Reject a behavior change disguised as a rename, directional values without overflow/indicator proof, or early removal of the legacy prop.                                                                                                                                          |
| Governing rules         | `architecture:container-padding/INV9–INV11`; `spec:AST-002/DEC-1–DEC-2`; `spec:AST-017/DEC-1`.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

This table is a review projection; the body below is authoritative.

## Intent

TabList's current opt-in is edge compensation: it consumes the full inherited
host inset, moves visible edge-tab content toward the surrounding content line,
and retains Tab-owned interaction padding plus TabList-owned divider, overflow,
and indicator geometry. Content reaches the host line only when that inset is at
least the edge tab's own padding. The public `isFullBleed` name is misleading
because the strip restores uncovered content inset after the outer box expands.

## Compatibility and migration

- Released default preserved: `yes`; omission keeps current TabList geometry.
- Compatibility class: the canonical alias is additive while the released
  `isFullBleed` prop remains; removing that prop is a breaking change in the next
  minor release under `spec:AST-017/DEC-1`.
- Controlled/uncontrolled behavior: active-value control is unchanged.
- Migration decision: `component:TabList/DEC-1`.

During the compatibility window:

- `edgeCompensation="inline"` is the canonical spelling;
- omitted `edgeCompensation` plus `isFullBleed={true}` selects the same mode;
- `isFullBleed` is deprecated and maintained examples use the canonical prop;
- if both props are supplied, explicit `edgeCompensation` is canonical and the
  legacy boolean cannot disable it.

The removal release MUST include a `[breaking]` Changeset for
`@astryxdesign/core`, consumer release notes, and an `astryx upgrade` codemod that rewrites
`isFullBleed` to `edgeCompensation="inline"`.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- The TabList-wide edge-compensation mode and its compatibility alias.
- The relationship between the outer TabList box, inner strip padding, edge tabs,
  focus-ring room, overflow controls, and selection indicator.
- Which logical edges are supported by the public mode.

**Does not own / non-goals**

- Host padding publication, nesting, or overlay resets — owned by
  `architecture:container-padding`.
- Button or List edge-compensation projections.
- New `start` or `end` values without separate proof and owner approval.
- A change to navigation/tab semantics, selection state, keyboard behavior, or
  overflow ownership.

| FR1 | The current opt-in MUST remain edge compensation: the outer TabList box consumes the full inherited inline host inset and any `hasDivider` rail spans that expanded width; the inner strip restores `max(host inset - edge-tab padding, 0)` at each logical edge. Visible edge-tab content reaches the host line only when the host inset is at least the tab padding; otherwise it moves toward that line without crossing the host boundary. | Current source and `component:TabList/DEC-1`                      | Shipped behavior                                         |
| FR2 | Compensation MUST preserve Tab interaction padding, focus-ring room, overflow detection and controls, scroll access, selection-indicator geometry, and the optional divider rail's expanded inline span.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Current source plus owner direction                               | Shipped behavior; expanded evidence required with rename |
| FR3 | `edgeCompensation?: 'inline'` MUST become the canonical API without changing FR1–FR2 geometry or the omitted default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `architecture:container-padding/INV10`; `component:TabList/DEC-1` | Accepted contract; implementation pending                |
| FR4 | During the deprecation window, omitted `edgeCompensation` plus `isFullBleed={true}` MUST produce the canonical `inline` behavior. Explicit `edgeCompensation` MUST remain authoritative when both props are supplied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Compatibility decision                                            | Accepted contract; implementation pending                |
| FR5 | `isFullBleed` MUST be removed in the next minor release only after maintained docs/examples use `edgeCompensation`, both paths have compatibility evidence, and the removal includes a `[breaking]` Changeset plus an `astryx upgrade` codemod for mechanical consumer migration.                                                                                                                                                              | `component:TabList/DEC-1`; `spec:AST-017/DEC-1`                   | Accepted contract; implementation pending                |
| FR6 | `start` and `end` MUST remain rejected until per-edge overflow, clipping, scroll-control, focus-ring, indicator, direction, and theme-padding evidence receives owner approval.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Shared logical vocabulary and TabList boundary                    | Accepted boundary                                        |

### Allowed variation

- Layout, size, role, selected value, labels, tab content, and overflow mode may
  vary while the same edge-compensation meaning is preserved.
- The implementation may retain the current outer-box/inner-strip technique or
  replace it with equivalent geometry that satisfies FR1–FR2.
- A host may be painted or bounded only where TabList's component-specific
  evidence proves the outer box, clipping, focus, and indicator behavior safe.

### Representative states

| State                 | Required invariant                                                                                                       | Allowed variation                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default/omitted       | Current TabList box, strip, and tab geometry are unchanged.                                                              | Any current layout, role, or overflow mode.                                                     |
| Canonical inline mode | Outer box consumes each host inset; edge content reaches the host line only when that inset is at least the tab padding. | Host inset smaller than, equal to, or larger than edge-tab padding; asymmetric insets; LTR/RTL. |
| Divider               | `hasDivider` rail spans the expanded outer inline width.                                                                 | Fitting or overflowing strips.                                                                  |
| Legacy alias          | `isFullBleed={true}` matches canonical inline geometry during the compatibility window.                                  | The canonical prop may also be present.                                                         |
| Overflowing strip     | Scroll access, edge fades, controls, and selected-tab reveal remain correct.                                             | Start/end overflow independently.                                                               |
| Focused edge tab      | The focus ring remains visible and local to the tab.                                                                     | Keyboard or pointer focus.                                                                      |

### Transformation and precedence order

- **ORD1 — Public input.** Resolve explicit `edgeCompensation`; otherwise map
  `isFullBleed={true}` to `inline` during the compatibility window; otherwise use
  no compensation.
- **ORD2 — Host geometry.** Read the matching inherited logical host insets, with
  missing values falling back to zero.
- **ORD3 — Component geometry.** Resolve edge-tab padding and focus/indicator
  allowances from TabList-owned sources, restore the non-overlapping portion of
  each content inset, and preserve interaction padding and owned affordances.

### Performance and resources

- **PR1 — CSS-first geometry.** The rename MUST add no observer, listener,
  state, Effect, or render pass. Existing overflow measurement remains unchanged.

## Accessibility contract

- **AR1 — Interaction remains stable.** Edge compensation MUST NOT change the
  tab/nav pattern, accessible names, selected state, keyboard movement, tab stop,
  focus target, or controlled value behavior.
- **AR2 — Overflow remains reachable.** Compensated edge geometry MUST NOT clip or
  hide a focus ring, selected indicator, visible tab content, or an overflow
  control required to reach offscreen tabs.

## Design relationships

| Anatomy or state  | Design requirement                                                                                    | Representation authority  | Hierarchy role | Component contract |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Outer TabList box | Consumes the full inherited inline host inset; with `hasDivider`, its rail spans that expanded width. | `component:TabList/DEC-1` | Supporting     | FR1–FR3            |
| Inner strip       | Restores `max(host inset - edge-tab padding, 0)` and owns scrolling/fades.                            | Current TabList behavior  | Structural     | FR1–FR2            |
| Edge Tab          | Retains interaction padding and visible focus/selection treatment.                                    | Tab composition           | Prominent      | FR1–FR2, AR1–AR2   |

## Family and system relationships

- `architecture:container-padding` owns host publication, the shared
  `edgeCompensation` vocabulary, logical-edge semantics, and overlay reset.
- `architecture:public-component-api` and `spec:AST-002` own public API
  admission; `spec:AST-017/DEC-1` owns the breaking classification and migration
  evidence required when the released alias is removed.
- TabList owns its specialized host, overflow, focus, and indicator projection.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — TabList migrates from full-bleed wording to edge compensation

**Reference:** `component:TabList/DEC-1`

**Decider:** cixzhang, 2026-09-21

TabList's current mode consumes the full inherited inline host inset, keeps an
optional divider across that expanded width, and restores only the portion of
content inset not already supplied by edge-tab padding. The user-facing intent is
therefore edge compensation, not a promise that tab content itself reaches an
outer edge. `edgeCompensation="inline"` becomes the canonical spelling;
`isFullBleed` remains a compatibility alias until its `[breaking]` next-minor
removal, with the required codemod and release evidence.

## Open questions

None.

## Content boundary

This claim-scoped contract does not duplicate TabList's complete navigation,
selection, overflow, or theming contract, consumer examples, implementation
steps, or List/Button projections. Those remain with their named owners.
