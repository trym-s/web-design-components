/**
 * @file useScrollSettle.ts
 * @input A scroll container ref and a settle callback
 * @output Calls back once, after scrolling (including momentum) stops
 * @position Internal behavior hook; consumed by Wheel.tsx and MonthScroller.tsx
 *
 * A snap scroller commits its value when it comes to rest, so it needs a
 * "scrolling stopped" signal. `scrollend` is that signal, but it is recent
 * enough that mobile Safari below 26 does not have it — and it is exactly the
 * browser this component targets. So: listen for `scrollend` where it exists,
 * and fall back to a quiet-period timer everywhere else. The same
 * belt-and-braces pattern is in core's `useScrollSpy`.
 *
 * ## The two things the timer must not mistake for rest
 *
 * A quiet period is a guess, and on iOS it guesses wrong twice unless it is
 * told otherwise. Both mistakes were behind the same bug: opening the
 * month/year wheels, flicking to an earlier month, and watching the month
 * climb on its own afterwards — on real iOS and the simulator, never in
 * Chrome.
 *
 * 1. **A finger resting mid-drag is not rest.** Hold a wheel still for a
 *    moment without lifting and the scroll events stop, so the timer fires
 *    and the value commits to whatever is under the band. Chrome hides this
 *    because it has `scrollend`, which does not fire until the touch is
 *    released.
 *
 * 2. **Momentum is not rest either.** iOS momentum runs on the UI thread and
 *    keeps going for a second or more after the finger is gone, and its scroll
 *    events arrive irregularly — the gaps in the slow tail routinely exceed
 *    any sane quiet period. Chrome's compositor-driven momentum fires evenly,
 *    so the same timer never trips there.
 *
 * A premature settle is not just a wrong value; it feeds back. The commit
 * moves the value, the value moves the scroller back onto the committed row,
 * that programmatic scroll does not stop the momentum still running
 * underneath, and the fresh scroll events start the next premature settle —
 * each one landing a row further along, which is why the month climbed.
 *
 * So: the settle waits for the touch to end, and then for a quiet period
 * measured from the LAST scroll event, which is what makes it outlast
 * momentum however long it runs. {@link useScrollSettle} also reports whether
 * the scroller is at rest, so a caller can refuse to reposition one that is
 * still moving.
 *
 * SYNC: When modified, update DateInputTouch.test.tsx.
