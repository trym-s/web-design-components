# BottomSheet component contract

## Intent

BottomSheet presents caller-provided content in a panel that rises from the
bottom edge. This draft records current consumer anatomy, keyboard-reachable
scrolling, and theming reachability without changing public API.

## Compatibility and migration

- Released default preserved: `yes`
- Compatibility class: additive internal content box and shared scroll behavior;
  public props, defaults, targets, and caller child ordering inside the content box
  remain unchanged
- Controlled/uncontrolled behavior: unchanged
- Migration decision: none

Consumer migration instructions belong in consumer docs and release notes.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- The visual Sheet panel and its current `bottom-sheet` target.
- The scrolling Content area, its shared viewport/content-box integration, and
  automatic keyboard-path selection.
- Standalone sheet presentation, including its optional native-dialog Scrim.

**Does not own / non-goals**

- Caller-provided content rendered inside the Content area.
- A separate target for Content area, Handle, or Scrim; none exists on current
  `main`.
- A shared switcher dialog or scrim — owned by BottomSheetSwitcher when the sheet
  participates in that host.
- Shared layer hosting or dismissal policy.

## Public concepts

No new public concept is introduced. Consumer props and usage remain documented
in `BottomSheet.doc.mjs`.

## Behavioral and layout contract

| ID  | Candidate invariant                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Basis                              | Draft review state                                 |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| FR1 | The current presented sheet contains one Sheet panel, one scrolling Content area, and one decorative Handle; a Scrim is present only in scrim-backed presentation.                                                                          | Current source, docs, and tests    | Verified current behavior; no new behavior decided |
| FR2 | The Sheet panel carries `bottom-sheet`; Content area, Handle, and Scrim carry no BottomSheet public target.                                                                                                                                 | Current source, docs, and tests    | Verified current behavior; no target change        |
| FR3 | Content renders in one real observed content box. Effective overflow, containment, and keyboard access come from `useScrollableArea`; the named overflowing body delegates forward Tab entry to a safe first sequential native link/button. | `spec:AST-025`; issue #5207; tests | Focus-time prototype for owner review              |

### Allowed variation

- Caller-provided children may vary without becoming BottomSheet-owned anatomy.
- Height, snap points, motion phase, and standalone versus switcher hosting may
  vary without changing the four-part anatomy recorded here.

### Representative states

- A standalone modal sheet renders Sheet panel, Content area, Handle, and Scrim.
- A standalone non-modal sheet renders Sheet panel, Content area, and Handle
  without a Scrim.
- A switcher-managed sheet renders the same panel anatomy while
  BottomSheetSwitcher owns the shared dialog and optional Scrim.

### Transformation and precedence order

- No new height, gesture, motion, or styling precedence rule is introduced.

### Performance and resources

- No new performance or resource rule is introduced.

## Accessibility contract

- **AR1 — Keyboard scroll path.** The named body is a tab stop while effectively
  overflowing. On forward Tab entry, the shared hook may delegate to the first
  sequential native link/button outside navigation-key-owning surfaces. It keeps
  the body stop for excluded content and skips the body on reverse traversal
  from the delegated first child.
- **AR2 — Focus continuity.** Content, overflow, or eligibility changes MUST NOT
  move focus. Pointer/programmatic body focus never delegates. A focused body
  losing overflow remains programmatically focusable.

## Design relationships

| Anatomy or state | Design requirement                                                                    | Representation authority       | Hierarchy role | Component contract |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Sheet panel      | Presents the painted bottom-edge surface and owns panel geometry and motion.          | Current source and public docs | Prominent      | FR1, FR2           |
| Content area     | Provides the scrolling area for caller-provided sheet content.                        | Current source and tests       | Prominent      | FR1, FR2           |
| Handle           | Presents the decorative grab affordance and owns the panel's drag interaction region. | Current source and tests       | Supporting     | FR1, FR2           |
| Scrim            | Dims and blocks the page in a scrim-backed host.                                      | Current source and public docs | Supporting     | FR1, FR2           |

Content area, Handle, and Scrim are stable visible parts, but no current public
target reaches them. Their `none` dispositions record factual reachability, not
a decision that they must remain unthemeable.

### Theming anatomy

<!-- anatomy-theming:v1 -->

```json
{
  "Sheet panel": {"target": "bottom-sheet"},
  "Content area": {
    "none": {
      "reason": "reachability-gap: No current public target reaches the scrolling content area."
    }
  },
  "Handle": {
    "none": {
      "reason": "reachability-gap: No current public target reaches the handle bar or pill."
    }
  },
  "Scrim": {
    "none": {
      "reason": "reachability-gap: No BottomSheet public target reaches the native dialog backdrop or switcher-owned scrim."
    }
  }
}
```

## Family and system relationships

- `architecture:component-theming-surface` owns anatomy qualification, target
  mapping, and factual `none` dispositions.
- `architecture:layer-runtime` owns the current native-dialog host distinction
  and records that sheets retain local scrim and swipe behavior.
- `spec:AST-025` owns effective scroll measurement, overflow and containment,
  automatic keyboard-owner selection, and focus continuity.
- `family:overlay-dismissal` owns shared Escape and platform-close ordering and
  records BottomSheet's current local-only adoption gap. This anatomy backfill
  does not migrate that runtime behavior.

Existing tests directly assert the Sheet panel target, Content area placement,
Handle structure, and scrim behavior. Source and public target metadata confirm
that the other three parts have no public target.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — BottomSheet adopts automatic shared keyboard ownership

**Reference:** `component:BottomSheet/DEC-1`
**Decider:** cixzhang, 2026-09-13

BottomSheet supplies its existing label to
`keyboardAccess.owner="contentOrViewport"`. The shared hook keeps the overflowing
body named and tabbable, delegating forward keyboard entry to a safe first native
link/button. Pointer/programmatic focus and excluded content keep the body path. BottomSheet retains `stickyContainment="always"` because the
body deliberately remains the sheet-local Sticky boundary.

A real flow-root content box supplies the hook's observation seam while preserving
representative margin, float, percentage-height, flex/grid-child, and hug-height
behavior.

## Open questions

- **OQ1 — Should Content area, Handle, or Scrim gain a stable public theming
  target?** (`human-api`) Their current lack of reachability is an audit gap, not
  settled intent.

## Content boundary

This file does not duplicate consumer prop tables, examples, gesture algorithms,
implementation steps, or shared layer and theming rules. It links to their
owners.
