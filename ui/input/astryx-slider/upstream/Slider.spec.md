# Slider component contract

## Intent

Slider presents a labeled control for selecting one numeric value or a bounded
range. This contract records its consumer anatomy and theming ownership, including
an additive target for the interactive control surface.

## Compatibility and migration

- Released default preserved: `yes`
- Compatibility class: additive target and state reflection only; runtime,
  default styling, DOM semantics, and public props remain unchanged
- Controlled/uncontrolled behavior: unchanged; Slider remains controlled
- Migration decision: none

Consumer migration instructions belong in consumer docs and release notes.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- The current slider row, background track, filled range, tick marks and labels,
  thumbs, and adjacent text value presentation.
- The `slider`, `slider-control`, `slider-track`, and `slider-thumb` public
  targets.

**Does not own / non-goals**

- Label and validation-message presentation — owned by `component:Field` and
  `component:FieldStatus`.
- Value-tooltip presentation — owned by `component:Tooltip`.
- New public targets for the filled range, tick marks, mark labels, description,
  or adjacent text value display.
- A decision that the current target asymmetry should be preserved or removed.

## Public concepts

This adds one public theming target without adding or changing a component prop,
value domain, or behavior. Consumer props, modes, states, and usage remain
documented in `Slider.doc.mjs`.

## Behavioral and layout contract

| ID  | Candidate invariant                                                                                                                                  | Basis                                   | Review state                                       |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| FR1 | The current render places a filled range, one or two thumbs, and optional tick marks over the background track.                                      | Current source, docs, and focused tests | Verified current behavior; no new behavior decided |
| FR2 | `Slider`, `Interactive control`, `Track`, and `Thumb` carry the `slider`, `slider-control`, `slider-track`, and `slider-thumb` targets respectively. | Current source, public docs, and #6224  | Approved additive target contract                  |
| FR3 | Filled range, tick marks, mark labels, and adjacent text value display are stable rendered parts without their own current Slider target.            | Current source and public docs          | Verified current asymmetry; not ratified as policy |
| FR4 | Label and status presentation continue to use Field and FieldStatus; value tooltips continue to use Tooltip.                                         | Current source and focused tests        | Verified composition boundary                      |

### Observed current target asymmetry

ProgressBar currently exposes targets for its fill and marks, while Slider
exposes targets for its root row, interactive control, background track, and
thumbs but not its filled range, tick marks, mark labels, or adjacent text value
display. This is implementation evidence for a joint audit, not approval of
either component's remaining target shape.

### Allowed variation

- Orientation, single or range mode, disabled state, value-display mode, and the
  number or labels of supplied marks remain current capabilities rather than
  separate target names.
- A description, status message, mark label, text value, or value tooltip may be
  absent without changing the remaining anatomy.

### Representative states

| State                    | Required invariant                                                      | Allowed variation                                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Single value             | One thumb and a filled range render over the track.                     | Orientation, value, disabled state, value display  |
| Range value              | Two thumbs bound the filled range.                                      | Values and minimum step separation                 |
| With marks               | Tick marks and optional mark labels align to the same range geometry.   | Mark count, values, and label presence             |
| With shared field output | Field or Tooltip renders the requested label, feedback, or value layer. | Description, status, disabled reason, tooltip mode |

### Transformation and precedence order

- No new value, snapping, geometry, interaction, or styling precedence rule is
  introduced.

### Performance and resources

- No new performance or resource rule is introduced.

## Accessibility contract

This contract does not change or extend Slider's existing accessible name, value,
range-thumb naming, description/status association, keyboard behavior, disabled
behavior, or value-tooltip behavior.

## Design relationships

`Interactive control` names the pointer/keyboard hit surface and the composite
opacity boundary around the rail, fill, marks, and thumbs. `Filled range`, `Tick
mark`, `Mark label`, and `Value display` remain stable consumer anatomy, but no
current Slider target reaches them. The map records those gaps without making
their absence intentional. `Value display` names the adjacent text mode; the
separately listed value tooltip retains Tooltip's target.

## Family and system relationships

- `architecture:component-theming-surface` owns anatomy qualification, factual
  `none` dispositions, and composition-preserving target ownership.
- Field, FieldStatus, and Tooltip retain their existing public target contracts
  when composed by Slider.
- Slider and ProgressBar both render a track, a filled segment, positioned
  indicators, and optional value presentation, while their current target
  coverage differs. That evidence requires a future joint family/audit pass; it
  does not declare a current family, require a new target, or authorize runtime
  behavior changes.

The focused Slider suite asserts the `slider-control` target's orientation and
disabled state. Source/metadata guards cover all four target declarations. The
suite covers only the disabled-reason Tooltip path, not the
`valueDisplay="tooltip"` composition; that anatomy is source-inspected and
remains missing focused test coverage.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — Interactive control is public Slider anatomy

**Reference:** `component:Slider/DEC-1`
**Decider:** cixzhang, 2026-09-14

The stable pointer/keyboard interaction and compositing surface is a
consumer-recognizable part, so it carries `slider-control`. `Thumb` remains
separate anatomy and continues to carry `slider-thumb`. This adds no default
behavior or styling change.

## Open questions

- **OQ1 — After a joint ProgressBar and Slider family audit, should any shared
  painted parts have aligned target coverage?** (`human-api`)

This question records the audit need only. It does not presume that either
component should add, remove, or rename a target.
