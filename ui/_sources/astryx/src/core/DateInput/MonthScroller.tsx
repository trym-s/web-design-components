 * @file MonthScroller.tsx
 * @input Month bounds, selected value, constraints, week start
 * @output Exports MonthScroller and MonthScrollerHandle
 * @position Internal component; consumed by TouchDateField.tsx
 *
 * The continuous surface: months stacked vertically in one scroller, each pane
 * exactly as tall as the scrollport and snapped to its start. Two consequences
 * fall out of that single geometric choice — the picker never changes height,
 * and there is no resting position that shows half of two months.
 *
 * Every pane is a fixed six-row grid, including the months that only need
 * four or five, because a pane whose height depended on its contents would
 * make snap offsets vary from month to month and the scroll position drift.
 *
 * The list is long (a century by default) but only a few panes are ever
 * mounted: a spacer holds the full scroll height and the visible panes are
 * positioned into it absolutely. Nothing is stitched or recycled during a
 * scroll, so snap offsets are constant and momentum is never interrupted —
 * which is the failure mode of the usual "append months at the edge" approach.

  /**
   * Put the scroller back on a pane boundary once the gesture is over.
   *
   * `scroll-snap-type: mandatory` is supposed to make this unnecessary, and
   * on a static list it does. This list is virtualized: seven panes exist out
   * of twelve hundred, and the panes ARE the snap areas — so every month the
   * finger crosses mounts one and unmounts another, mid-fling.
   *
   * iOS scrolls off the main thread. It picks a landing place from the snap
   * points it knows about at the time, and a React re-render that lands after
   * that decision moves them; the scroller then comes to rest where no snap
   * point exists any more, and nothing re-snaps it. That is the calendar
   * sitting between two months with the weekday header still square — the
   * grid is not skewed, the scrollport is simply parked a couple of columns
   * into a pane. Chrome hides it by snapping again after the mutation.
   *
   * So the rest position is corrected here rather than trusted. It waits for
   * a true settle — touch released AND quiet, since iOS below 26 has no
   * `scrollend` and its momentum outlasts any naive timer (see
   * useScrollSettle) — and only moves when the offset is genuinely off, so a
   * scroller the browser snapped for itself is left alone.
   *
   * ## Why it re-checks that the scroller is still
   *
   * A quiet period is not proof of rest, and getting that wrong here does not
   * merely fail to fix the bug — it REVERSES the user's swipe. iOS runs its
   * own snap animation for ~150-300ms after the finger lifts, and the scroll
   * events it fires during that animation arrive irregularly; a gap longer
   * than the quiet period is routine in the slow tail. The settle then lands
   * mid-animation, reads a scrollLeft still travelling toward April, rounds
   * THAT to the nearest pane — which is still March, because the animation is
   * not yet halfway — and drags the calendar back where it came from. Swipe
   * forward, get pulled backward, which is what this looked like on a device.
   *
   * Two samples a frame apart settle it: if the offset moved, the scroller is
   * still going somewhere and its destination is not ours to guess. Skipping
   * costs nothing, because the animation's own scroll events re-arm the
   * settle, and the last of them gets a quiet period that ends at true rest.
   *
   * The threshold is a subpixel rather than exact equality. A scroller at rest
   * on a fractional-density viewport can report an offset that wobbles in the
   * last decimal place, and exact equality would read that as travel and never
   * correct at all — the failure mode being silent, which is the worst kind.
   * A tail crawling slower than half a pixel a frame has effectively arrived,
   * so treating it as arrived is right anyway.
   *
   * The correction is at most half a pane by construction, and its own scroll
   * settles onto the boundary it just aimed at, so it cannot oscillate.
