 * @file Step.tsx
 * @input Uses React, stylex, theme tokens (including the motion duration token
 *   the connector fill animates on), StepperContext, and per-step theme selector
 *   state
 * @output Exports Step component and StepProps
 * @position Individual step item; used inside Stepper
 *
 * Every connector this file draws — the separated progress bars and the
 * on-track segments alike — paints its accent fill as a scaled ::before rather
 * than by swapping a background color, so a step the flow advances into grows
 * its line along the track. See the CONNECTOR FILL block in the styles below
 * for the axis/RTL/reduced-motion rules that go with it.
 *
 * Exactly one change animates: advancing a single step. Going back, jumping
 * forward by more than one, and mounting mid-flow all land at once. The rule
 * and the reasoning behind it sit above the styles; the arithmetic that keeps
 * the one animated span reading as a single front — an on-track span is drawn
 * by two steps, three where a content slot splits it — is in the component.
 * Nothing about it is public API: Stepper hands each Step the step it came
 * from through context, and the rest is derived. In a compact horizontal
 * Stepper, each track node is presentational rather than clickable; navigation
 * moves to the named previous/next controls in the summary row. The on-track
 * layout keeps each indicator on the rail and does not repeat the active one
 * beside the summary label. Each public content slot stays mounted and is
 * hidden to preserve local state.

//
//  1. `CurrentIcon` (a dot inside a ring) has no registry equivalent — it is a
//     progress affordance, not a general-purpose icon.
//  2. `CheckCircleIcon` (a filled circle with a check) is intentionally NOT the
//     registry `success` glyph, even though the two look similar. They mean
//     different things and must stay independently restyleable: `completed`
//     marks *progress through the sequence* (every step you've passed), while
//     the semantic `success` status marks a step's *outcome*. A stepper can
//     show a completed step that also carries a `warning`/`error` status, so
//     collapsing the two glyphs would conflate progress with outcome. The
//     semantic `success`/`warning`/`error` STATUS glyphs DO defer to the themed
//     registry (see the status branch below), so those share one visual
//     language; only the progress marks are local.
//
// Both glyphs paint via `currentColor`, so the indicator's color is still
// controlled by tokens on the wrapper (never hardcoded), and the wrapper
// carries the `astryx-step-indicator` theme target.

/**
 * How much of itself a connector gives up where it meets the indicator, read

 *
 * Clipped, not padded. The gap has to apply to two layers — the track, which is
 * the segment's own background, and the accent fill, which is an absolutely
 * placed `::before`. Spending it on each separately meant two declarations on
 * two boxes: a percentage then resolved against a different containing block
 * for each and stopped them ~1.2px apart. `clip-path` is ONE declaration on the
 * segment that clips the element and its pseudo-element together, against one
 * reference box — so every accepted value behaves the same way on both layers,
 * which is what a public input owes its full value domain.
 *
 * Clipping also cannot change layout: the segment keeps its box, so the node it
 * positions cannot move and the Stepper cannot grow. A raw `1rem` padding grew
 * a 180px stepper to 240px.
 *
 * Still clamped, because the value arrives with nothing in between to reject
 * it. Both halves earn their place, and not for the reasons padding needed:
 *
 * - `max(0px, …)` — `inset()` ACCEPTS a negative length. Chromium computes
 *   `inset(0 0 -4px 0)` as-is rather than dropping it, which is the opposite
 *   of padding (there CSS clamps a negative to `0` for you). This normalises
 *   it to `0` so a negative gap means "no gap" rather than a clip rect
 *   stretched outside the segment's own box.
 * - `min(…, --spacing-2)` — the flexible segment's own `min-height`, so an
 *   oversized gap leaves a short track rather than an unbounded one.
 *
 * The Stepper root explicitly inherits the property, so a horizontal Stepper
 * can receive a consumer value (or its 0px default) from the styled frame while
 * a theme can still set the property directly on the `stepper` target. The
 * use-site fallback supplies the same default to an unframed vertical Stepper.

// that is nearly full, and nearly full is indistinguishable from full, so the
// eye calls it arrived well before it settles. Run backward, the same curve
// ends with a shrinking stub of accent still on the track, and a remnant that

// both directions — measurably so — and the backward one still feels slow,
// because the tail is what is visible rather than what is hidden. No easing
// fixes that; only not animating it does. A multi-step jump fails differently:
// it is a navigation rather than a progression, and sweeping a front across
// four segments makes the user sit through a journey they asked to skip.
//

// flow went forward one step, and the line grows to show it. That span takes

/**
 * An individual step within an Stepper. Renders a 4px progress-bar segment,
 * an indicator (numbered badge, check, or any custom icon), a label with
 * optional description, and an optional content slot.
 *
 * Progress (completed / active / not-started) is derived from the parent's
 * `activeStep` and this step's `step` prop. The optional `status` prop layers a
 * semantic meaning on top: in the default `auto` indicator mode it recolors the
 * indicator and swaps in a matching glyph (`success` → green check-circle,
 * `warning`/`error` → the shared Input status icons). The current step always
 * keeps its current-step ring. `status` never recolors the connector/track.
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * <Step step={0} label="Account details" description="Enter your email" />
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * <Step step={1} label="Payment" status="error" />
