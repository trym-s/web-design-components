# ChatLayoutScrollButton component contract

## Contract at a glance

| Area                    | Contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public contract         | `isVisible`, `label`, and `onClick`, plus root `div` passthrough, styles, and ref. No public surface changes here.                                                                                                                                            |
| Behavior                | A pill holding one ghost Button. Hidden state paints nothing and leaves the tab order; a non-empty `label` expands the pill and becomes the visible text; omitted or empty renders icon-only.                                                                 |
| End-user impact         | A theme that restyles the documented target now repaints the pill a reader sees instead of an invisible full-width row behind it.                                                                                                                             |
| Builder impact          | None. Props, defaults, DOM shape, ref target, and passthrough element are unchanged.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Compatibility/readiness | Patch-compatible repair. The public target keeps its name and stays a single target; it moves onto the element that paints, which no `guaranteedProperties` declaration existed to promise before. Three inherited violations remain open (FR1a, FR3a, FR6a). |
| Review checks           | Reject a target on the centring row, a hidden pill that keeps keyboard focus, a non-empty label that is not also the accessible name, or a state that paints identically to its opposite. FR1a, FR3a, and FR6a are recorded open violations, not acceptances. |
| Governing rules         | `architecture:component-theming-surface/INV4, INV6`; `architecture:component-style-authoring/INV1, INV5`; `architecture:public-component-api/INV5, INV6, INV8`; WCAG 2.2 SC 2.4.7 and SC 2.5.8 (AA).                                                          |

This table is a review projection; the body below is authoritative.

## Intent

ChatLayoutScrollButton is the floating return-to-newest affordance for a chat
transcript. It owns the pill's appearance and its visible/hidden presentation;
it owns no scroll state. ChatLayout composes it with `useChatStreamScroll` and
`useChatNewMessages` by default, and a caller may replace or remove it through
`ChatLayout`'s `scrollButton` slot.

This record is an observational backfill written during the 2026-09-23
whole-component audit. It describes verified shipped behavior and the one
objective repair that travels with it. It adds no behavior, default,
compatibility promise, or design decision.

## Compatibility and migration

- Released default preserved: yes — `@astryxdesign/core@0.6.3` ships
  `isVisible`, `label`, and `onClick` with the same meanings.
- Compatibility class: theming repair. The target name, its documentation entry,
  and its count are unchanged; only the element carrying it moves, from the
  centring row to the pill it centres.
- Controlled/uncontrolled behavior: unchanged — visibility is a required caller
  input, and the component holds no state.
- Migration decision: `component:ChatLayoutScrollButton/DEC-1`

Consumer migration instructions belong in consumer docs and release notes.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- The pill surface: its fill, elevation, radius, resolved height, and the
  collapsed/expanded width ceiling.
- The visible/hidden presentation, including removal from sequential focus
  navigation while hidden.
- The default accessible name when the caller supplies no `label`.
- Centring within its parent, and the gap between the pill and what sits below.

**Does not own / non-goals**

- Scroll position, lock state, and new-message detection — owned by
  `useChatStreamScroll` and `useChatNewMessages`.
- Placement in the chat dock and whether the affordance renders at all — owned
  by `component:ChatLayout` through its `scrollButton` slot.
- Action semantics, focus ring, press feedback, size geometry, and variant
  surface — owned by `component:Button`, which this component composes.

## Behavioral and layout contract

Draft requirements identify their basis so observed code is not mistaken for an
intentional decision. A `current` contract contains no unresolved rows.

| ID   | Candidate invariant                                                                                                                   | Basis                                                                  | Draft review state    |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| FR1  | The control MUST expose a non-empty accessible name in every reachable state.                                                         | WCAG 2.2 SC 4.1.2                                                      | settled obligation    |
| FR1a | `label` omitted uses the translated default; a non-empty `label` is the name. **`label=''` currently satisfies neither** — see below. | current behavior, which violates FR1                                   | **violation of FR1**  |
| FR2  | While `isVisible` is false the pill MUST paint nothing and MUST NOT accept focus, programmatic or sequential.                         | current behavior; WCAG 2.2 SC 2.4.7                                    | settled               |
| FR3  | While `isVisible` is true the pill MUST remain keyboard reachable and activate on Enter.                                              | current behavior; WCAG 2.2 SC 2.1.1                                    | settled               |
| FR3a | A focused control MUST paint a visible focus indicator. **The ring is currently clipped away entirely** — see below.                  | WCAG 2.2 SC 2.4.7; `spec:AST-020/FR1`                                  | **violation of FR3a** |
| FR4  | A **non-empty** `label` MUST render as visible text; omitted or empty renders icon-only with no visible text.                         | current behavior                                                       | settled               |
| FR5  | The pill MUST take its resolved height from the element-size token so no theme scale makes it clip the Button it wraps.               | current behavior                                                       | settled               |
| FR6  | The public theming target MUST sit on the pill — the element painting fill, elevation, and radius — not on the row that centres it.   | `architecture:component-theming-surface/INV4`                          | settled               |
| FR6a | The target MUST expose the state axes that drive its painted styles. **Currently it reflects none** — see below.                      | `architecture:component-theming-surface/INV6`                          | **violation of INV6** |
| FR7  | The transition between states MUST collapse to `0s` under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.                                           | current behavior                                                       | settled               |
| FR8  | The collapsed control MUST fit a 24x24 CSS-px square.                                                                                 | WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8 (AA)                                                 | settled               |
| FR9  | Consumer `ref`, styles, and remaining DOM props MUST reach the component's outer element.                                             | current behavior; `architecture:public-component-api/INV5, INV6, INV8` | settled               |

**FR1a — the empty-label naming gap.** `label=''` is permitted by the public
type and is what ordinary caller code produces from an empty or not-yet-loaded
string. It reaches the Button as `label=''`, `aria-label=''`, and
`isIconOnly={true}`, because `??` passes an empty string through. Button sets
its own `aria-label` only when `label !== ''`, so the caller's empty
`aria-label` survives; icon-only renders no visible text; and the chevron Icon
carries no `label`, so it is `aria-hidden="true"`. The result is a focusable,
operable control with no accessible name.

This record states the obligation and records the current behavior as violating
it. Closing the gap means choosing between falling back to the default name,
rejecting the value, or treating an empty label as a caller error — a public
API and compatibility decision that belongs to the owner, not to an audit. See
OQ7.

**FR3a — the clipped focus ring.** The composed Button declares a focus ring
as an `outline` at a positive `outline-offset`, so it is painted entirely
outside the button's border box. The button fills the pill exactly (measured
32x32 in 32x32 collapsed, 149x32 in 149x32 labelled), and the pill clips with
`overflow: hidden`, which it needs to keep the collapse/expand animation inside
its own rounded shape. There is therefore no room for the ring on any side and
none of it is painted: captured frames of the focused control are byte-identical
to the resting control in both configurations and both color modes.

Keyboard access itself is intact — the control takes focus and activates — so
this is a visibility defect, not a reachability one. The remedy is a production
change to how the pill clips or where the ring is drawn, and the choice between
those changes rendered geometry, so it needs a visual review rather than a
settled correction. `spec:AST-029/FR7` would allow a settled objective fix to
travel with an audit; this one is not settled, so it is outside **this** PR.
Recorded as OQ8.

**FR6a — the unreflected state axes.** `isVisible` selects visible/hidden
styles and `label` selects collapsed/expanded styles, both on the painting
target, and `themeProps('chat-layout-scroll-button')` is called with no state
argument. A theme can therefore restyle the pill but cannot address either
state. Naming those axes is new public theming surface, so the shape belongs to
the owner. See OQ1.

### Allowed variation

- **AV1 — Expanded width.** The labelled pill's width ceiling is a component
  design decision, not a theme value. What happens to a label past that ceiling
  is not settled here; see OQ3.
- **AV2 — Resolved geometry.** Height, radius, spacing, and duration resolve
  from theme tokens, so absolute values differ by theme without becoming
  regressions.
- **AV3 — Composition.** ChatLayout renders this by default, but a caller may
  substitute any node or remove the affordance entirely.

### Representative states

| State                     | Required invariant                                                                                           | Allowed variation                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| hidden                    | paints nothing, refuses focus, keeps its layout box (FR2)                                                    | transition duration               |
| visible, label omitted    | named from the default, focusable, fits a 24px square, no visible text (FR1, FR3, FR4, FR8)                  | resolved pill size                |
| visible, non-empty label  | the label is both the visible text and the accessible name (FR1, FR4)                                        | expanded width up to the ceiling  |
| visible, empty label      | **fails FR1** — icon-only with an empty accessible name (FR1a)                                               | none; this is a recorded defect   |
| visible, hovered          | the pointer paints a state distinct from rest                                                                | the overlay the theme resolves    |
| visible, keyboard-focused | **fails FR3a** — focus is held and `:focus-visible` matches, but the ring is clipped away and paints nothing | none; this is a recorded defect   |
| visible, pressed          | the press paints a state distinct from hover and rest                                                        | the pressed treatment             |
| any visible state, themed | the documented target repaints the pill (FR6); its state axes are unreachable (FR6a)                         | which properties a theme declares |

### Performance and resources

- **PR1 — No state, no effects, no observers.** The component derives every
  rendered difference from its props during render and registers no listener,
  timer, observer, or animation frame.

Current measurements belong in the audit record; this subsection owns only
durable constraints and their verification target.

## Accessibility contract

- **AR1 — Named.** The control MUST expose a non-empty accessible name in every
  reachable state (WCAG 2.2 SC 4.1.2) (FR1). Omitted and non-empty `label`
  satisfy this; `label=''` does not, and that gap is recorded as FR1a rather
  than resolved here.
- **AR2 — Focus follows paint.** A control that paints nothing MUST NOT be
  focusable, because focus landing on it would have no visible indicator
  (WCAG 2.2 SC 2.4.7). `opacity` and `pointer-events` do not achieve this;
  `visibility` does (FR2).
- **AR3a — Focus is visible.** A focused control MUST paint a focus indicator
  (WCAG 2.2 SC 2.4.7). The ring is declared but clipped away; recorded as FR3a
  rather than resolved here.
- **AR3 — Target size.** The collapsed control MUST fit a 24x24 CSS-px square
  (WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8 AA) (FR8).
- **AR4 — Reduced motion.** The state transition MUST collapse to `0s` under
  `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` (FR7).
- **AR5 — Translated strings.** The default accessible name MUST resolve through
  the translator catalog, never a literal.

## Design relationships

| Anatomy or state | Design requirement                          | Representation authority | Hierarchy role | Component contract |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------ |
| pill surface     | floating affordance over the transcript     | unsettled                | supporting     | FR5, FR6           |
| hidden state     | absent rather than dimmed                   | unsettled                | supporting     | FR2, AR2           |
| labelled state   | text accompanies the glyph on the same pill | unsettled                | supporting     | FR4                |

The component implements design requirements without copying their rationale.
An `unsettled` representation remains a human decision; principles do not let an
agent invent the answer. No `authority: current` design record covers a floating
scroll affordance today, so these rows record the gap rather than a requirement.

## Family and system relationships

- `family:buttons` owns the action surface this component composes through
  `component:Button`. This component is not a member: its public purpose is a
  transcript affordance that contains a button, and the family's membership rule
  excludes components that merely use a Button as an action slot. See OQ4.
- `architecture:component-theming-surface` owns the target/anatomy relationship
  this component's theming must satisfy; FR6 adopts INV4 directly.
- `spec:AST-029` owns the audit flow that produced this observational record.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — The public theming target rides the pill, not the row that centres it

**Reference:** `component:ChatLayoutScrollButton/DEC-1`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-23`

`architecture:component-theming-surface/INV4` requires a target to sit on a
stable visible element that paints theme-controlled output. The component
renders two elements: a full-width row that centres the pill and holds the gap
below it, and the pill itself, which paints the fill, elevation, and radius. The
target sat on the row, so a theme that styled the documented name painted a band
across the chat dock while the pill kept the surface the theme asked to replace.

The name, the documentation entry, and the target count are unchanged, and no
`guaranteedProperties` declaration existed to promise the old element, so this
repairs a reachability gap rather than removing a compatibility path.

Rejected: adding a second target for the pill. That is new public theming
surface for a component that needs exactly one, and it would leave the
non-painting target in place.

Rejected: moving consumer passthrough to the pill alongside the target.
`ref`, `xstyle`, `className`, `style`, and the remaining DOM props keep
landing on the outer element, which is the element the released type, the
existing passthrough test, and `architecture:public-component-api/INV5, INV8`
name as the contract's owner. Relocating them would change where a caller's
`id`, `data-*`, and ref resolve, which is a compatibility decision and not part
of this repair.

## Open questions

- **OQ1 — Should the target reflect its style-driving states?** (`human-api`)
  The pill selects between visible/hidden and collapsed/expanded style objects,
  and `themeProps` reflects neither, so a theme cannot address either state.
  Exposing them means adding `visualProps`/`states` to a public target, which is
  new theming surface rather than a repair.
- **OQ2 — Is `isVisible` the right name on a non-layer component?** (`human-api`)
  The shared convention reserves `isOpen`/`isVisible` for layer components. The
  prop is released in `@astryxdesign/core@0.6.3`, so any change is breaking and
  needs a compatibility decision.
- **OQ3 — What should happen to a label past the expanded ceiling?** (`human-design`)
  The pill clips at its width ceiling with no ellipsis and no wrap. The
  accessible name survives, so only sighted readers lose text, and locale
  expansion is the realistic trigger. No `authority: current` design record
  covers truncation for this surface.
- **OQ4 — Does this component belong to `family:buttons`?** (`human-api`)
  Its public purpose is a transcript affordance, and it is absent from the
  family's member list, but it is a single composed Button with no other
  content. The family contract's exclusion for "components that merely use a
  Button as a trigger or action slot" is the reading applied above.
- **OQ5 — Is animating the pill's `max-width` acceptable?** (`human-design`)
  Expanding and collapsing animates a layout property. Reduced motion is
  honored and the subtree is one button, but the record that would govern
  animated properties, `design:motion`, is `authority: draft`.
- **OQ6 — The consumer doc has no anatomy inventory.** (`human-api`)
  `architecture:component-theming-surface` records this as open migration work
  across Core, so no `### Theming anatomy` block is written here: there are no
  published anatomy names for it to map.

- **OQ8 — How should the focus ring escape the pill's clip?** (`human-design`)
  The pill needs `overflow: hidden` for its collapse/expand animation, and the
  Button's ring is drawn outside its border box, so the two are in direct
  conflict. Candidate answers — inset the button so the ring fits, draw the
  ring on the pill, or clip on a different element — each change rendered
  geometry and belong to a visual review.
- **OQ7 — What should `label=''` do?** (`human-api`)
  It currently produces an unnamed control (FR1a). The candidate answers — fall
  back to the translated default, reject the value in the type, or treat it as
  a caller error — are a public API and compatibility decision on a released
  prop, so the audit recorded the violation instead of choosing one.
