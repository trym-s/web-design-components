 * stroke width of `0` hides the arc along with the track; an arc with no track behind
 * it is `--spinner-track-color: transparent`.

// spinner: { 'size:xl': { '--spinner-diameter': '40px' } }.
//
// Declaring is only safe because #5410 moved the compiled StyleX CSS inside
// `@layer astryx-base`. Before it, StyleX emitted custom-property
// declarations at priority 0 and therefore OUTSIDE its layers, and an
// unlayered declaration beats every layer — so a StyleX-declared
// `--spinner-diameter: 10px` shadowed the theme's own rule no matter how
// specific the theme got. An earlier revision of this component worked around
// that by never declaring the public var and reading it with the default as a
// `var()` fallback; that is no longer necessary, and the fallback shape has a
// cost of its own — with nothing declaring the var,
// `theme-var-reachability.js` cannot find an element to check, so a documented
// var reads as unreachable.
// Arc fraction is not itself size-dependent, but it declares alongside the
// two vars that are, on the same per-size condition (`!hasLabel` gate at the
// call site) — it needs a home on whichever element carries the theme
// target, and this is the object already wired to be there.
