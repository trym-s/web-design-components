# Resizable component contract

## Intent

Resizable combines the useResizable state and behavior hook with a focusable
ResizeHandle. The handle presents a default Grip pill over an enlarged invisible
Grab zone. AST-010 adds explicit pixel and percentage configuration while keeping
selected state, persistence, callbacks, paint, and ARIA in resolved pixels.

## Compatibility and migration

- Released default preserved: `yes`; numeric and exact `Npx` stay pixels, exact
  `N%` retains released one-time default behavior, and the broad `defaultSize`
  string type remains source-compatible
- Compatibility class: 0.6 removes the deprecated pixel-bound aliases after two
  stable releases; numeric `minSize` / `maxSize` preserve their pixel semantics
- Controlled/uncontrolled behavior: unchanged
- Migration decision: CSS-like `min()` / `max()` strings are not supported. Use
  `percent(value, {min: pixel(value)})` or
  `percent(value, {max: pixel(value)})`.

Consumer migration instructions belong in consumer docs and release notes.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- useResizable size, collapse, snapping, persistence, and resize lifecycle.
- ResizeHandle's separator semantics, pointer and keyboard interaction, and
  current `resize-handle` target.
- The default Grip pill and its current `resize-handle-pill` target, plus the
  aligned invisible Grab zone.

**Does not own / non-goals**

- The structural region being resized — owned by LayoutPanel, SideNav, or another
  caller.
- Layout-region topology, inset, divider, or scrolling rules.
- A public target for the Grab zone; none exists on current `main`.
- Fixing the missing runtime reflection for the documented Handle `direction`
  theming state; that remains a separate theming follow-up.

## Public concepts

`ResizableSize` is a Resizable-specific union: pixel number, exact `Npx`, exact
`N%`, `PixelWidth`, or `ResizablePercentSize`.
`pixel(value)` is Table's existing canonical structured pixel helper;
`percent(value, {min: pixel(value)})` creates a literal percentage with a pixel
floor; `percent(value, {max: pixel(value)})` creates one with a pixel ceiling.
The options argument is required and the two bounds are mutually exclusive.
`defaultSize` retains its released broad `SizeValue` type and adds the structured
`PixelWidth` and `ResizablePercentSize` values; runtime validation remains
authoritative for legacy strings.

Numbers and exact `Npx` remain pixels. A descriptor default resolves once; a
descriptor bound remains live. Consumer props, outputs, and examples are documented
in `Resizable.doc.mjs` and `useResizable.doc.mjs`.

## Behavioral and layout contract

| ID  | Candidate invariant                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Basis                            | Draft review state                                            |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FR1 | ResizeHandle renders one focusable Handle and one enlarged Grab zone; the default render also contains a Grip pill, while caller-provided children replace that pill.                                                                    | Current source, docs, and tests  | Verified current behavior; no new behavior decided            |
| FR2 | Handle carries `resize-handle`, Grip pill carries `resize-handle-pill`, and Grab zone carries no public target.                                                                                                                          | Current source and public docs   | Verified current target inventory; no target change           |
| FR3 | Pointer, keyboard, collapse, snap, persistence, reversal, and size behavior remain owned by ResizeHandle and useResizable rather than layout-regions collaborators.                                                                      | Current source, docs, and tests  | Verified current ownership; resize semantics remain unchanged |
| FR4 | Resizable metadata advertises `direction` as a Handle visual state, but current runtime calls `themeProps('resize-handle')` without reflecting that value, so direction selectors cannot match.                                          | Current source and public docs   | Verified audit gap; deliberately not fixed in this change     |
| FR5 | `percent(value, {min: pixel(value)})` and `percent(value, {max: pixel(value)})` resolve against the AST-010 basis; a default selects pixels once, while a bound re-resolves and clamps selected pixels. Both/neither bounds are invalid. | AST-010, source, tests, Chromium | New structured sizing behavior; selected state remains pixels |
| FR6 | `minSize` and `maxSize` are the only bound spellings in 0.6; numeric values retain pixel semantics, and the upgrade codemod rewrites static inline uses of the removed aliases.                                                          | AST-010, source, codemod tests   | Breaking cleanup with mechanical migration                    |

### Allowed variation

- **AV1 — Axis.** Handle may resize along the horizontal or vertical layout axis;
  separator orientation and cursor follow the current implementation.
- **AV2 — Placement.** Handle may participate inline or overlay its parent, and
  Grip pill may sit at start, end, center, or the current automatic side.
- **AV3 — Grip content.** Caller-provided children may replace Grip pill without
  changing Handle or Grab zone ownership.
- **AV4 — Divider.** Handle may paint its current divider treatment; a composing
  region remains responsible for avoiding a duplicate adjacent divider.
- **AV5 — Structured percentage bound.** A descriptor carries exactly one `min`
  or `max`, whose value is a `PixelWidth`. Atomic percentages use the existing
  exact `N%` string; arbitrary CSS expressions are outside this contract.

### Representative states

| State                  | Required invariant                                                    | Allowed variation                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Default handle         | Handle, Grab zone, and Grip pill render.                              | Divider and always-visible treatment may vary.     |
| Custom handle content  | Handle and Grab zone remain; caller content replaces Grip pill.       | Caller content remains caller-owned.               |
| Horizontal or vertical | Interaction follows the selected axis and current ARIA orientation.   | Size, reversal, and pill placement may vary.       |
| Collapsed or expanded  | Handle preserves valid separator value semantics and resize controls. | Grip pill automatic side follows current behavior. |
| Disabled               | Handle remains represented but is removed from interactive tab order. | Painted treatment follows existing styles.         |

### Transformation and precedence order

- Parse atomic strings exactly; validate `percent()` descriptors as a finite 0–100
  percentage with exactly one finite non-negative pixel bound.
- Resolve percentages against one active basis, then apply the descriptor's floor or
  ceiling.
- Commit a structured default as one initial pixel choice; keep percentage bounds
  live and clamp with `Math.min(max, Math.max(min, size))`.
- Maximum wins when resolved bounds conflict; interaction and persistence stay
  pixel-only.

### Performance and resources

- Atomic pixel paths add no observer or render work.
- A structured default observes a supplied container only until its initial pixel
  choice is final; persisted pixels skip that measurement.
- Percentage bounds reuse the shared ResizeObserver and remain subscribed while
  live. Structured validation and resolution are constant-time; no CSS parser is
  introduced.

## Accessibility contract

The structured API does not change ResizeHandle's separator role, label,
orientation, collapsed value text, focus, pointer, or keyboard behavior. Its
`aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, and `aria-valuenow` remain the same resolved pixel
values used by hook state and painted geometry.

## Design relationships

| Anatomy or state | Design requirement                                                      | Representation authority       | Hierarchy role | Component contract |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Handle           | Presents the focusable resize separator and optional divider treatment. | Current source and public docs | Prominent      | FR1, FR2, FR3      |
| Grip pill        | Presents the default visible resize affordance.                         | Current source and public docs | Supporting     | FR1, FR2           |
| Grab zone        | Enlarges pointer reach while remaining visually transparent.            | Current source and tests       | Supporting     | FR1, FR2           |
| Direction state  | Selects horizontal or vertical resize presentation.                     | Current public metadata        | Supporting     | FR3, FR4           |

Grab zone is interaction structure rather than a painted public theming seam. Its
`none` disposition records factual reachability. The missing Handle direction
reflection is a separate current audit gap: the target exists, but runtime does
not emit the documented target state.

### Theming anatomy

<!-- anatomy-theming:v1 -->

```json
{
  "Handle": {"target": "resize-handle"},
  "Grip pill": {"target": "resize-handle-pill"},
  "Grab zone": {
    "none": {
      "reason": "intentional: The invisible pointer hit area is nonvisual interaction structure and has no public target"
    }
  }
}
```

## Family and system relationships

- `architecture:component-theming-surface` owns anatomy qualification, target
  mapping, and target-state reflection requirements.
- `architecture:interaction-modality` owns shared modality behavior;
  `architecture:public-component-api` owns the additive structured API and
  compatibility boundary.
- `Resizable/utils` is server-safe and re-exports Table's exact `pixel()` binding
  plus `PixelWidth`, alongside Resizable's `percent()` and structured types.
- `family:layout-regions` lists useResizable and ResizeHandle as collaborators
  that may drive a LayoutPanel's size. Resizable is not a layout-regions member,
  and that family does not own or redefine resize state, snapping, persistence,
  collapse, pointer, or keyboard semantics.

Current tests exercise Handle and Grab zone structure and behavior but do not
render `children` to prove that custom content replaces Grip pill. That branch is
source-inspected and lacks focused regression evidence. The documented
`direction` visual axis is a closed union, so `extensibleAxes.test.ts` does not
cover its missing runtime reflection; that mismatch is currently unguarded.

## Decision log

### Structured percentages use a Table-style helper

**Decision:** `percent(value, {min: pixel(value)})` or
`percent(value, {max: pixel(value)})` represents a percentage with exactly one
pixel bound. Reuse Table's exact `pixel()` binding and `PixelWidth`; do not create
a parallel static helper. The required options and XOR type avoid a second
spelling for plain percentages and make every supported combination explicit.
The pure helper is available with the same `pixel()` binding from the server-safe
`Resizable/utils` subpath, matching Table's established helper/export pattern.
`proportional()` is deliberately not reused because it means sibling weight, not a
literal percentage.

**Rejected:** parsing recursive CSS `min()` / `max()` strings. That would create a
partial second CSS implementation without a demonstrated need for arbitrary
composition.

  target-state reflection?** (`checkable`)
