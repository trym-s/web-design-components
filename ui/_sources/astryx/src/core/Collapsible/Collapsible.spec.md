# Collapsible component contract

## Intent

Collapsible reveals and hides one content region from one disclosure trigger. Its
chevron communicates the same open state in two intentional layout patterns: a
trailing status indicator or a leading disclosure arrow aligned before a column of
labels.

The public axis is the chevron's logical position. Callers do not provide arbitrary
cue content or replace Collapsible's disclosure rendering.

## Compatibility and migration

- Released default preserved: yes. Omitting the new position keeps the current
  trailing chevron and current no-prop rendering.
- Compatibility class: additive optional public axis with a stable default.
- Controlled/uncontrolled behavior: unchanged.
- Migration decision: `component:Collapsible/DEC-1`.

Consumer migration instructions belong in consumer docs and release notes.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- the disclosure trigger, its `aria-expanded` / `aria-controls` relationship, and
  the chevron that represents the open state;
- the `start | end` logical chevron-position axis;
- position-specific chevron direction in collapsed and expanded states;
- group default, item override, and nested-item isolation for chevron position; and
- trigger-label layout needed to preserve the position contract.

**Does not own / non-goals**

- caller-provided chevron, cue, icon, or render-function escape hatches;
- TreeList, Table, or another component's disclosure indicator;
- generic icon resolution or artwork customization;
- a shared responsive or directional API; or
- new content-reveal motion behavior. Existing behavior outside this decision stays
  unchanged until its own current authority changes it.

## Public concepts

| Concept                | Closed values or states | Meaning                                                                      | Availability                     | Default                                   | Owner                                        | Stability | Invalid-value behavior                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| chevron position       | `start`, `end`          | logical side of the trigger label that owns Collapsible's disclosure chevron | Collapsible and CollapsibleGroup | `end`                                     | `component:Collapsible`                      | stable    | rejected by the public type               |
| disclosure state       | collapsed, expanded     | whether the controlled region is hidden or revealed                          | every Collapsible                | existing state owner                      | `component:Collapsible` or group state owner | stable    | existing controlled/uncontrolled behavior |
| group position default | absent, `start`, `end`  | common position supplied to direct group items                               | CollapsibleGroup                 | absent, so item default resolves to `end` | `component:Collapsible`                      | stable    | rejected by the public type               |

The public prop is named `chevronPosition`. The exported value type is
`CollapsibleChevronPosition`. `placement`, `side`, and rendering terminology are
not parallel public names for this axis.

| FR1 | Collapsible MUST expose `chevronPosition?: 'start' \| 'end'`; omission resolves to `end`.                                                                                                                                                         | owner API decision; preserves released default            |
| FR2 | `end` MUST render Collapsible's chevron after the trigger label in logical order.

| FR3 | `start` MUST render Collapsible's chevron before the trigger label in logical order. Collapsed `start` points inward toward the label/content, so its inline direction mirrors under RTL; expanded `start` points downward.                       | approved leading-disclosure behavior                      |
| FR4 | Position changes the chevron glyph/direction as well as DOM order. Reusing a vertical down chevron and rotating it sideways MUST NOT make collapsed `start` point away from its content.                                                          | direction and representation decision                     |

| FR7 | CollapsibleGroup MAY provide one `chevronPosition` default to its direct Collapsible items. A direct item's explicit position MUST override the group default.                                                                                    | approved group-coherence behavior                         |
| FR8 | A Collapsible nested inside another item's revealed content MUST begin a new presentation scope and use its own explicit position or the component default. The outer group's position MUST NOT leak into the nested disclosure.                  | approved nested isolation behavior                        |
| FR9 | Chevron position MUST NOT change disclosure semantics. The same trigger remains a button, retains `aria-expanded`, identifies the controlled region with `aria-controls`, and follows the existing state owner.                                   | existing accessibility and behavior contract              |

### Allowed variation

- **AV1 — Artwork implementation.** The exact internal Icon names and transform
  implementation may change if FR2–FR4 remain visually and directionally true.
- **AV2 — Spacing mechanism.** Margin, gap, or equivalent internal layout may
  separate a leading chevron from its label while preserving FR6.
- **AV3 — Group consistency.** An item may explicitly override its group's
  position. Mixed positions are supported by precedence but should remain an
  intentional exception rather than an accidental row-to-row pattern.
- **AV4 — Existing non-chevron behavior.** Open-state ownership, disabled behavior,
  divider/density presentation, content layout, and reveal motion remain governed
  by their existing authority and are not changed by this decision.

### Representative states

| State                              | Required invariant                                                           | Allowed variation                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |

| `start`, expanded                  | chevron precedes label and points down                                       | internal transition mechanism        |

| group `start`, item `end`          | direct item resolves to `end`                                                | presentation-context implementation  |
| group `start`, nested item omitted | nested item resolves to component default `end`                              | context-reset implementation         |

### Transformation and precedence order

- **ORD1 — Position precedence.** Item `chevronPosition` → direct surrounding
  CollapsibleGroup `chevronPosition` → component default `end`.
- **ORD2 — Direction resolution.** Resolve position and open state first; apply
  document direction to `start`'s inward inline direction. `end` remains a vertical
  down/up indicator and does not mirror into a horizontal cue.

## Accessibility contract

- **AR1 — Disclosure semantics stay primary.** The trigger MUST expose its expanded
  state and controlled-region relationship independently of the chevron artwork.
- **AR2 — Position is visual order, not reading duplication.** Moving the decorative
  chevron MUST NOT duplicate the accessible name or add a second focus target.
- **AR3 — Direction remains understandable.** The collapsed leading cue MUST point
  toward the content in both LTR and RTL; it MUST NOT retain an LTR physical
  direction under RTL.

## Design relationships

The two positions express established disclosure patterns:

- `end` is a trailing status indicator: down when collapsed, up when expanded;
- `start` is a leading tree/file-browser disclosure arrow: inward when collapsed,
  down when expanded.

This contract chooses those relationships but does not expose arbitrary icon or cue
selection. Themes may style the owning Collapsible target without changing the
semantic direction or position states.

## Family and system relationships

- The public `useCollapsible` hook retains its existing state behavior and consumer
  documentation. This component owns the rendered trigger, chevron, and aggregate
  component/group protocol.
- `architecture:public-component-api` owns reachability and compatibility of the
  admitted position prop and exported type.
- `architecture:react-component-runtime` owns context identity/lifecycle; this
  record owns the presentation value and nested-scope outcome.
- `spec:AST-002/DEC-1` admits this axis because otherwise-identical disclosure
  layouts require caller-owned leading versus trailing patterns. It does not admit
  custom cue rendering.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — Chevron position is the public axis

**Reference:** `component:Collapsible/DEC-1`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-07`

Callers may choose the logical chevron position `start` or `end`. Collapsible owns
the cue and derives its position-specific glyph and direction. `start` exists for
leading disclosure patterns such as tree/file-browser rows; `end` preserves the
released trailing indicator.

Rejected: `chevronPlacement`, `none`, `hasChevron`, caller-provided cue content, and
rendering callbacks. Those surfaces expose rendering machinery or permit the
component's disclosure affordance to disappear rather than expressing the approved
caller-owned layout distinction.

### DEC-2 — Group defaults do not leak through content

**Reference:** `component:Collapsible/DEC-2`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-07`

A CollapsibleGroup may provide position to its direct items, and an item may
override it. A Collapsible nested inside an item's body starts a new presentation
scope so an outer list's visual convention does not silently alter an independent
disclosure.

## Open questions

None.

## Content boundary

This file owns Collapsible's durable semantic concepts, chevron-position behavior,
precedence, and evidence. Consumer prop tables/examples remain in
`Collapsible.doc.mjs` and `CollapsibleGroup.doc.mjs`. Exact Icon names, transforms,
StyleX declarations, context fields, implementation plans, audit results, and pull-
request verdicts do not belong here.
